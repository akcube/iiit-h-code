food is descent enough desert options were also goodstarrers were also tastyone bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time
short review decent breads and starters bad shaam savera a little screwed up daal makhni but should be a oneoff case better ambience at night and importantly good quantityi wanted to give a 25 but thats not an option extensiveambience its better at night friends who had been here during the day didnt like it much so if you prefer ambience go at nightfood ordered a hara bhara kebab shaam savera daal makhni rotis and raita yes im a vegetarian the good part quantity i was excited to see shaam savera on their menu but take it from me you do not want to order it it is no where close to what it should be they messed it up real bad especially the colorsthe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me it wasnt creamy too the breads and raita were decentthe hara bhara kebabs were decent too soft they had an extra outer coating of peanuts so if youre not a peanut fan on your kebabs ask them to skip that step conclusion it looked like they had made food in a hurrywould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases if things change youll know
excellent food and very good service by soumen dasambience was good too with live music food was served timely decor of the restaurant was amazing as well
my review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lots of place even though the food is good in places like these special hey to papiya shuvro
it was a very nice experience food was amazing friendly staff with welcoming attitude papia was very friendly and accommodating good ambiance i will definitely recommend this place
had dinner with my friends menu is perfect something for everyone service was awesome and papia was very accommodating good ambience with amazing live music will be back definitely
service experience was very good especially by papiya food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well i would like to visit beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price
service food and ambiance was very nice staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food live music was like cherry on the cake
the food was we ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all papiya shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all
staff are just polite and responsive food is the best part here and it is better as ambience also awesome here i met two persons here named papiya and shuvro who are the best at their services food items i liked here were basket biryani and kodi drum sticks finally just loved
i came here with my parents we ordered for thai peneer tikka kaju pulao and veg biryani the kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good this is a decent place to go with family shubro and papiya served well
well were new to hyderabad and i can for a fact say that its probably the best place ive eaten a buffet at in hyderabad period especially id like to thank shurvo and papiya for their amazing service double metha was just too good overall a worthwhile experience
wonderful place with awesome ambience best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods shubro and papiya were good with service
good ambience and great serviceweve had buffet for 25 peoplethe waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went badshoutout to shubro and pradeep took care of our entire afternoon
my review of the place comes after multiple visits that have spanned over 4 months and now i can safely say that its one of the good places aroundtheyre located near the biodiversity signal above fabindia theres ample parking for both two and four wheelers the ambience is a bit dim after dark and the seating is divided into various options including a pdr sectionthe menu design is in the shape of a bottle and the array spans continental chinese and indian cuisines heres the list of things that i have tried across all my visitspanko crumbed mozzarella sticks cheese sticks that are coated and fried pure cheese blissveg lasagna this place has one of the good lasagne in the towncrispy chilli corn kernels the usual favourite this one has a slightly different presentation heremakhmali paneer tikka cottage cheese shashlik sizzleritalian nachos nachos topped with red sauce and cheese and baked in the dishcheese and cheese pizza soft base pizza loaded with cheese and a few pieces of green olivesi cannot stress enough on how i have loved all that i tried here i have also tried out their lunch buffet the variety may not be as elaborate as other places but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings it is at least a onetime try but what i really adore here is their mocktails beyond delight is an absolute delight also a fan of the guava and chilli and apple and kiwi night drinksthe staff is ever so courteous a special mention to papiya and shuvro who were our attendants on the latest visit the place has zomato gold 1+1 which further brings down their reasonable rates a meal for two would roughly be around 700 that fills not only your tummy but also you heart
had lunch today at beyond flavors the food was very good and delicious and awesome service was provided by soumen das shuvro would highly recommend the restaurant
the reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables we went on friday afternoon we waited almost more than 30mins to get a table we lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didnt get a table even aftr waiting for such a long timei think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer
service is really exceptional cheers to manav who served us really well food was nice too loved the ambience too with nice music playing in the background
soumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soonsoumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soonsoumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soonsoumen das waited our table thanks buddy for a great service will visit soon

we went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in zomatothe spread in buffet is too less just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters 2 main course in veg and non veg just one fried rice and chicken biryanidesserts are ice cream and jamunthe taste was ok and not to expect too much little disappointing when starters are not hotfish fry was decent schezwan chicken was okveg spring rolls were too goodbig surprise for me is onion rings as starters kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavourchicken was ok biryani is average egg fried rice was goodfor the money we pay we expect some good food they use much of colour in food itemssuggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in startersoverall experience is ok but they can be much better for the amount you pay
the place is just beyond beautiful ambience is excellent and food is good the service by soumen das is extremely good highly recommended place

we went for a team lunch such a worst restaurant food was tasteless service was very slow and ac was not working weve requested them multiple times but its of no use please dont waste your money and i strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours
discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office walked in and ordered some food thinking itd be the same takeout food one could get at any outletbut but the food turned out to be a saviour and the way theyve designed this place is indeed remarkable the lights and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food
second time being here its really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well very courteous staff and very hospitiletaste is good but the best part is presentation its really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant very impressed with mr ahmed pradeep and mr dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well good job guys keep it up
we ordered vegetable lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka both of which were absolutely delicious the ambience is amazing and the service is good
one of the best food experiences i had in hyderabad the desserts was yum appricot pudding is must have ahmed khan your service was unparalled keep up the good work
ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour he may suggest great food as he has good experience the staters and sizzler was too good the sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eatgreat experience in beyond flavors
had dinner at this place and the attendant was papiya the staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome good variety of food and beverages
we happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really likedneedless to say the ambience and music was really good we had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seatthey served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really goodthe buffet spread was one of a kindstrters veg paneer tikka veg spring roll and veg cutletthey were lil cold but the taste wad goodnon veg chicken kebab chicken manchurian and fish fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hotchicken was fair enufsingapore noodles egg salad and pasta they were good but it was coldmain course mutton rogan josh chicken tikka masala palak paneer all were equally goodbiriyani egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really greatdesserts moong dal halwa tasted really yumm ice cream gulab jamun cut fruits banana cakethe staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slowwe had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach fullthey could improve the above points to stand betteroverall 32
good ambience with an absolutely delicious foodive got best company here by ananya beyond flavours the place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staffgreat place for friends
i have been at this place for dinner a few days back the ambience was good the restaurant was almost half occupied we immediately got a table but then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu that too after a few reminders we ordered a few starters main course items and mock drinks only the starters could be served in 30 mins there was no sign of mock drinks we noticed similar service issues on other tables noticed guests literally shouting on the staffthe food was just average dishes were not prepared well at least when compared to 41 rating on zomatowe finally decided to just have starters and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal
i have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences1st time it was with colleagues and i loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly their special baked biriyani is work a try its unique and tastybecause of the good experience i revisited this place with my sister she orders a mocktail and it was terriblethey replace it but it was still not good and then i asked them about a starter if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both its disappointing to know that the staff doesnt know about the menu
its one of the best places to hangout with friends seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etcfood was very good and the ambience was also very niceloved everything
ambience is good and staff are polite and friendly food is super good and had nice time having lunch keep up the good work thank you for your nice hospitality loved it
i would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt if you add that yo your food it would taste way better so basically none of the food we ordered had salt we ordered fries panko mozzarella sticks tomato cream soup panner65 italian nachos not sure how that was nachos or italian they basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top the beans were not baked at all and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave the paneer 65 was horrendous might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt next was the mozarella sticks which was again cold and no salt the only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup thanks to gid we didnt order any main course all these came up to 1300 and odd thanks to zomato gold our price went down this place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve and talking about the restaurant in general the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots they really need to clean up more
hostile staff okeish food not so great ambiance not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 41starters were decent but main course was horriblewill not suggest this place
thanks ahmed food is great will recommend to visit again and again service is excellent and ambience is good we had a great time with my family
this is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of moneyi am personally highly recommend this placegreat flavour of food and very much prompt serviceambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant
food quality and taste is not good super slow service nice ambience but very poor in customer handling lot of items not available even if in the menu
this was my worst experience at a restaurant ever first our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour then had to wait for another half hour to get our food and the worst of all they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna we figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it i do not recommend this place at all there are so many better places in gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service
this is the place i really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food loverpasta and sizzlers are so yummy that i cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than otherservice is the part were you really satisfied
im very much impressed by the quality of food and service specially mr ahmed thank you for your politeness and readiness about food i can only say that it is beyond flavours loved this place must visit great ambience
the food was indeed beyond falvours ahmed served us well hoping to meet next time soon a great ambience and amazing songs on the background added innumerous flavours to the delicious food
starters are very good and service is also good ahmed is very polite and helped us selecting menul which tuned out be great would like to come back again
had a very bad experience herebeyond flavours really puts you beyond all the flavourshad gone here for dinner and the next day had to get hospitalised because of food infectioni guess the food was not served fresh
lovely ambienceroasted chicken soup was the highlight of our dinnerbasket biryani was full of flavours and yummlasagne was greatnice to go with whole familyappetisers quantity is less though
i liked the food and ambience but the problem is with the staff they are not so responsive weve ordered one item but we got something else otherwise place and the food are good
its a worst service experience food was ok they took 45mins to get veg pulav never seen a restaurant to take such time wont visit again
waiters are not good enough and you will get items which you have not ordered overall a bad experience waiting time is more than expected
awesome food very good ambience centrally located ample parkingcoordination between serving boys service has scope for improvement boys very courteous though not sure why the bar was closed on a saturday eveningoverall good experience extremely value for moneywill visit again
was there for office lunch outing rating would be mixed because food was fine but service was very bad booked table a day before but still had to wait for 3040 mins to get one manager was polite but gave some rubbish reasons for bad service ambiance is fine

here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in gachibowli area this colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhhambience is quite good and has optimum free space this place seems to be set up for team lunches only the menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you wont be able to taste each and every item i dont even remember all the namesstarters are mouth watering as i write may it be veg or non veg to begin start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it this section includes sushi golgappa aamras shot etc this is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste budsdelicious starters are served on your table the one of the attraction is the pizza oven you can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a master chef certificate hoping you may use it in your resume main course also has some delicacies worth trying i am not naming any because i was having foodgasm that i hardly cared to read namesdesserts ahhahahhhaayou have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets i had gulaab jamun halwa pastries and pan ice cream which is highly praised here the ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch you will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etconly drawback is that during high incoming rush staff is in a hurry and you cant have much leisure timei would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang i believe that you wont regret trying this fabulous placesection wise ratingsambience 35 5staff 35 5food 4 5buffet items 45 5overall 4 5

this place is very nice food was awasome guys are very goodwe are visiting flehazo restaurant thats lovely placei think this place is very good place
it was my birthday and i had a wonderful first experience jayant accompanied us with all the best starters both veg and non veg and made us very comfortable me and my wife had a wonderful lunch on my special day loved the place and foood is awesome
services jayanta are wonderful starters are very good to start with mango flavour prawns adds classic mango taste wish pizza is also good for different pizza lovers overall a fantastic experience
the ambience is awesome love the service and the staff here the variety of starters and desserts are yumm and it is a pleasure evenin the service by jayanta at flechazo gachibowli was awesome and very warm
sabir excellent service panner verry good v kabab nice in the main course dal was very tasty coconut noodels was mouth watering in the desserts gulab jamun was very yum
good food good service value for money friendly staff sabir one of the staff members was at our service did great job it has a splendid menu both in non veg n veg p
we had a great time here staffs are vry polite and friendly especially jayant was very nice to us overall food was good highly recommend
i have given my bday treat to my friends guys its an awesome place to dine their starters are so good to have we had great time with jayant
hithis time we are not satisfied in flechazo starters are not much hot most of them are room temparature or little warm we have asked for fish starter we got only two pieces bbq wings are not good tooo hard mango chilli prawns not much tasty only maida coating smell no flavour nothing we are not happy with flechazo gachibowli
wide spread buffet taste is good too courteous staff very polite we had a family dinner there and all of us had a lovely time especially kids love the live counters
im not going to this place again though the ambiance is good flechazo gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene we went there as a family the first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor the chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place you find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around another unique practice i noticed was that while the waiter serves you the starters he is constantly touching the serving spoons tongs to the half eaten food in your plate then you find him serving the same starters to the next tablethe place is chaotic with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters the main course buffet has limited choices toobut for the well thought of ambience there is nothing positive i could write about this place
the starters were good especially mutton starter they are many varieties in chicken then other items the ambience is so good and the staff is great jayanta service was very good and food was on time thanks to them
flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world the mediterranean and asian it has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatheringsfood shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in gol gappas kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the diy concept to the tablestarters stuffed mushroom is a good option and veg tempura is well balanced in its spice contentmain course you will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani rice and curries leave some space for the pasta thoughdessert this section gives a whole new meaning to the term spoilt for choicethis place is indeed a foodies delight
visited on 12 may 2019 for lunch with family awesome food comfortable seating soothing ambience booked table through zomato and received confirmation in 3 minuteswent in early at 1130am brunch welcome drink soup and starters served at the table they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them super deliciousapart from the buffet spread they have live counters for pizza pasta chaats pani puri yummm sushi keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks starters are aplenty veg and non veg the servers are attentive and helpfuldesserts was a mix of indian sweets pasteries cheesecakes fruits and their speciality liquid nitrogen icecream fun to watch though i am not sure if healthyi was surprised with a mothers day cake complements of the restaurant that was a wow gesture a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food
i was there on the mothers day and food was amazing service by jayanta ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggd
i went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomatogood things first the service is excellent the waiters literally takes care of you when you are therefood nothing great as am more of a starter person i love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse its not served the way you like it the sushi and pani puri were very okayish typemain course was very normal nothing extra ordinary taste of the food was very normalin dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was goodservice its very good and all the servers are trained very wellambience the place was jammed packed even for a tuesday lunch couldnt enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counterall in all a very okayish lunch

md sabir is very good at service must try this place if youre nearby staff is very professional polite and friendly theyll make you feel comfortable
heard about this restaurant from a friend and choose this place to have team lunchratingambiance 4food 3service 4there were many items on list but taste was not so gooddont be fooled by word unlimited beverages only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you cant choose the flavourtotally felt disappointed by taste but customer service was good
good place to hang out with friends the panipuri on the conveyer belt and making your own pizza are the main highlights for this place
oh i had so much hope on this place looking at the descriptions and all but this just turned out to be an imitator of abs may be with few concept changes here and there ok the food is fine and all but its just the expectation of being different
an decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters the place was crowdy even on a week day servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying but the finger food on conveyor belt was cold the pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment couldnt get to main course but the spread seemed interesting would love to visit again
place was good for starters and mocktailsshabir was handy in servicepasta was to the top notchprawns were gooddeserts are love must try their mini gulab jamun
one of the best place in terms of hospitality food and ambience everything was superbstaters 5 5ambience 5 5main course 5 5desserts 5 5best of the buffet is their live counter pizza and smoky ice creamit has to be in ur list definitely
4 starspros1variety of starters2option to make pizza pasta by your own hands3good biryani in main course a rareity now a days 4atleast 8 items in desert the jalebi was specifically good 5staff behaviourcons1only one softdrink avialiable for every day one flavour so if you are unlucky u have to drink orange juice if you go on tuesday even if u dont like it2no hard drinks availableoverall a very nice experience go and enjoy
i absolutely loved this place let me begin how comfortable this place is the sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy we were served with welcome drinks few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of chat and fish later actual starters were served to us on our place for a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try for vegetarian chilly paneer crispy corn chilly fries here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later the mediterranean pasta is better than the white one later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting the food was also good in sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good even try pan ice creamthe staff here is courteous and friendly as welloverall you can enjoy a happy long fun lunch or dinner with your friends family colleagues
loved the food here especially baby potato in harissa and sweet chilli barbeque prawn is must try in starters and smoked paan ice is just wow mini pizza and pasta is also good herethankew sabir for your awesome service and helping us pick d best one had a good dining

this is one place that provides a very good buffet for the price that you pay the quality of food is great they maintain a variety of items across each coursethe fish served as a part of starters was the best i had eaten in a very long timemutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mentionthe service is good and the staff is courteous toobut sadly despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide this was disappointing and could have been avoided
soothing ambience admirable hospitality by shabir and buffet was delicious in every section perfect place for family friends and office colleagues

ambience is awesome especially faijul service is good and friendly it is a good place for team outing overall we had a good experience and fun
it is seldom you see a restaurant with 49 rating my friend and i had come with great expectations but the restaurant didnt manage to live up to any of it even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there coming to the food the sushi isnt good the chef isnt aware that you dont give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi the starters were okay and we didnt repeat anything in spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn then in aglio olio they used macaroni the main course had a terrible array of dishes and none was good the biriyani had no chicken the couscous salad had just quinoa and olives the chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk all in all a very forgettable experience however to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special
i visited flechazo today with my family the ambiance is very pleasant the service provided by ranjit and ramjan was excellent food was nice we have several options for starters especially i liked fish starters very much main course is also very good coming to desserts i love the ice cream they made on the spot this provides several food options in all starters main and desserts one the best place to try with family
good food and friendly staffmehrul sourab have been best best buffet in town fish in starters and rabdi in desserts are to be tasted must
very polite service done by shabir starters korean tossed chicken oriental devilled prawns were excellent veg flexhazo style crispy corn is good too
apart from the starters the main course dessert the wonky table we sat on was just a big disappointment the ice cream was made with just cream and chocolate sauce with dry ice and that is not good
very mild and refreshing taste best for starters and deserts thanks to ramzan ranjit and pritam for helping out with the dishes and continued follow up with the taste of the dishes
the food was amazing with good ambiance the staff was very friendly totally worth the visit especially ranjit and pritam were too good at their job and concerned about their costumers visiting here again when in gachibowli
went with a group of 9 people for buffet the place had nice ambience and excellent food hamid and kushals service was impressive they even danced with us it was a really fun experience

liked the food its was good but not anything special or memorable good service but i do not appreciate how the waiters pestered me into writing a review no wonder this place a high rating staff will keep bugging you till you write a good review

great ambience and lovely foodeating festival for food lovers like meservice is excellent brothers hamid sanjit and jakirul have taken good care of usour baby enjoyed special status on spiceless food n painting playing time
haleem the best place to try outavaialble in all multiple outletshaleem usually found in the ramdan season months of march to july served by shah ghouse and badam kheer are must try
ordered chicken fried rice very good however didnt give curry with it not sure whether they forgot but did like the taste of the variety
wonderful place with good food taste i like the way they prepare the food there i like they serve to us and the way they maintain the restaurant clean
this time i have experienced mandi its very nice quality mandi lovers will sure love this here with i will request the restaurant add more pics of chicken r mutton
nice taste of biryani and the price was also fair ambience was goodwent with my team they loved itstarters were excellent with crisp and spices
no that good when compared to tolichowki branch starters are good but not the main course and biryanistolichowki is the main branch for shah ghouse
used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city to my dismay i ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12pm tastewise it seemed average but as i was hungry i finished it fast fell asleep at 2am to wake up at 5am with a severe upset stomach this went on and when i woke up by 10am my stomach still hurt im pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene standards nonetheless if they keep this up theyll gradually lose their clientele would recommend a place called cafe 555 their haleem is far tastier and doesnt come with the complimentary food poisoning
food is good but for the second time around they didnt send us our complete order had ordered 4 naans got only 2 also got daal tadka instead of daal makhani not sure if its the ramadaan rush but now twice in a row our online orders thru zomato have been messed up probably will avoid going forward
best hyderabad biryani if you are visiting hyderabad and you are a non vegetarian you must visit this place and taste the authentic hyderabadi biryani
i just went for the biryani and it didnt disappoint we ordered the special chicken biryani it was spicy and tasty and seemed proper hyderabadi one dish enough for two people easily decent service as wellambience 35 5food 45 5service 4 5cost 4 5
its a worst thing happened with mewe ordered for mutton family packhere i got chicken familypacki dont know whos neglegance is thiseither restaurant person or delivery boyi made a call to restaurent to know whats the problem is but they are not responding at allplease check when you asked for food delivery
i have placed order for mutton haleem special 3 qty and biryani rice 1 qty shah ghouse and zomoto together delivered shortage of mutton haleem special 1 qty informed to deliver executive while collecting parcel and reportes to zomoto support zomoto team said that no response from shah ghouse regarding shortage delivery finall zomoto also not confirmed anything and accepted refund only missed item value packing also very unhygienic totally upset with shah ghouse and zomoto
biryani was oily
i heard haleem will be so good etc etc but taste is not that great as others said just boiled the meat and grinded like paste nothing special in it
its a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems shah ghousetip ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me it tastes much better we also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious
always the best the taste of the biryani is so unique that i can close my eyes taste the biryani and tell that its shah ghouse biryanii deducted one point for the behaviour which could have been better not pointing towards any specific scenario but i would prefer ordering online from shah ghouse than going there and eating specially when i am latethe quality sets it apart from its competition it is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime i judge a restaurant by its consistency and shah ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality
ordered kaju panner they have delivered chicken curry so disappointed enquired with zomato delivery boy he says we just pick the item and come
i ordered mutton biryani for lunch today the mutton was not cooked properly it was hard and unchewable i had high expectations from this restaurant as i had heard good feedback from a friend i was really dissapointed
i had shawarma so many times in so many places but no one can prepare like him it was so tasty and price was also okay and they always respect the customer instructions
they send me wrong order i ordered mutton biryani and they send me chicken biryani and this app is worst app we cant even get in touch with customer care
in regular days its a good place to have a good biryani but during ramzan the quality of food goes down in terms of taste but haleem is always good here
the place to have one of the best biryanis in hyderabad chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome the food is hygenic and well cooked chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at timecheers rakshita nath
ordered haleem from shah ghouse it has got really very good taste quantity and consistency really satisfied with the order but samll suggestion please add some more dry fruits
my second haleem this year is shah ghouse and after that i have tried at 4 different places trust me the taste at shah ghouse stands out and it makes you go back at its crowded outlet and have more of it 100 delicious
forgot to send the spoon
awesome taste must visit in hyderabad good place to visit with friends or if its for team lunch recently added mandi also yummy taste especially haleem
shah ghouse is a best place for hyderabad biryani their quality and quantity are really satisfied they have all the branches with same taste
i have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and i have never been so upset of course i have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which i ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now orders cant go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city yet another incident today where my order was wrong you can check with my name what i ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th may19hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes i wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either they deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time guess zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right
when you will order you will get other item surprising restaurantwheather you order chiken you will always get veg cheap cost item better to dont order food my suggestion because i ordered more then twice got less cost cheap unordered item save money
perfect place to order for mutton biryani and mandi superb taste but a miner issue with this restaurant is its so busy on weekends and they will not concentrate on ordered items and some times they deliver incorrect order otherwise its awesome
the waiters were very rude that the hotel is very busyif you ask for starters and soups they say it will late order biryaniinam shocked with their behaviour with customers
the contact number in the true caller shows best cheaters in the world goodi had ordered for mutton biryani nd i got noodles which are ugly wow i am so happy for thatgood keep it up bullshit how careless they are for delivering this type of service to customer who orders for foodthis is really disgusting and bullshiti suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant shah ghouse gachibowli better remove service from zomatomany of our friends had many issues from this restaurant like delivering different food from ordered food and delivering one shawarma instead of two and otherszomato authority should take of all these problems which are spoiling the name and fame
food and taste is fabulous nothing there to complaint but the way they use containers for delivery need to improve sometimes for curry orders packages are leaking out to be top all the facilities provided by restaurant should be in best quality
ordered special chicken biryani biryani was great in taste but ambience was not good also this restaurant is too unhygienic and over crowded
absolutely everything about shah ghouse is amazing you wouldnt mind the ambience much as food is finger licking good you can tell that the place serves good food as it is always crowded they serve the best mutton biryans shawarmas and murgh musallam not sure of the spelling 5 stars only for the food
will be visiting this place at least twice in a monthchicken biriyani and chicken lollipop will be fab hereprawns curry and rumali roti is goodmust try dryfruit falooda and butterscotch falooda
shwarma was really good biryani was average with hard huge chicken pieces paneer dish was also average they have seating for everyone from bachelors to family
the biryani here i found very delicious worth of money all spices were blended and mixed well but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste
amazing taste as compare to all other restaurants around gacchibowli telecom nagar hyderabadthey follow all instructions care fully so 5star
i ordered an egg biriyani and got a chicken piece in it disgusting never ever going to order from this restaurant again disappointed
not at all fresh
the chicken sp biriyani was just delicious wonderful service first try in hyderabad definitely one of the best experiences high speed delivery and hot food
ordered veg biryani here the vegetables they used especially beans are awful the are almost became like drumstick on chewing and cant eat them will never order again neither recommend to any
shah ghouse biryani is better than paradise its is very soft and warm when you open a packet and nice spice scent good quality of chicken its uses for biryani i always prefer to eat first this one in biryani category
me and my friends has a mandi at shah ghouse restaurant which was at gachibowli and our experience was really poor comparing to others restaurants in hyderabad
worst food no quality this would be the worst biryani i ever i had in my entire life this the chicken biryani without chicken and the chicken is mashed up and keema and i would say this is chicken keema biryani
food taste better here the food servicing is not that much good the food preparation time is bit high if you have patience to wait then you can give a try for it
the taste of biryani is so good rate is pocket friendly i recommend shah ghouse for good biryanigood food good taste like shah ghouse biryani
delivered on time
no onions for any biriyani full fake delivery dont order and believe them they are delivering false biryani and fake identity of original
biryani is good but tandoor was not up to mark but still for non vegetarian this place is heaven plenty of items at reasonable price
we ordered egg biryani and we were delivered chicken biryani with chicken replaced with eggs he tried his best to pose it as egg and biryani but he forgot to remove bones from the biryaniwouldnt order egg biryani from here again
ordered sechwan rice from here the rice was not cooked properly and it was too dry and hard to eat with full off oil i havent expected such food from this restaurant they should have eaten the food first before it is sending out for delivery
ordered regular chicken biryani but the rice was not cooked and the i ordered double masala which i didnt get and the taste was not that good which was great when i ordered before
biryani is always tasty the best part is restaurant remains open till late night whenever we have party plan we use to order from shah ghouse
taste is good but the service at gachibowli was really poor which compelled the guests to look for another option despite wanting to stay
mandi seema lovely items should definitely try it but item should be hot to better its taste service in the restaurant were not that good for the family orientated people there will be late what ever you try
very very bad experience for me the waiter servicing was very bad i really irritated a lot by this environment very bad feeling to me i requested u please improve customer servicing l they not even response us i should call 5 more times i really feeling very bad for me first time such a bad experience to me
the food served here is good and mutton biryani is super tastythe service is friendly we can order from our car like a drive inn one of a kind biryani ive ever ate
the biryani is awesome you will surely crave for it but only nonveg biryanichicken shawarma is toooo good and yummy yummy starters are also very tasty
was trying to go to ter charminar branch but due to small mistake in cab bookings ended up at tiz branch took ter ac hall in d 1st floor typical resto arrangement and ac was mild and filled with biryani aromaordered chicken tikka 230 juicy well marinated and perfectly cooked chicken qty was huge served with mint chutney splmutton biryani 280 biryani had huge portion which can easily serve two good eaters biryani was served with a egg and about 1012 pics of tender mutton pcs biryani lived up to its legendary status vfm 5 5
this is my first order in shah ghouse nice food perfectly cooked i ordered prawns biryani and i never had this taste in hyderabad especially aroma of rice was so tasty temperature of food quantity and packing is awasome
this is bloody disgusting i had to wait for more than 120 mins for my order and after that got a call for cancellation of the order if you cant sever the order let the customer know about it dont made him wait for a long time 120 mins of sunday is precious for me to hell with your service
i visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on zomato though the restaurant claims to be authentic original hyderabadi taste the gachibowli branch was open in 2015 given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic it looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complainingso for ambiance and hygiene its a complete nofood was okay we ordered apollo fish starter which was very hard and spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and paradise or pista house has better taste than it quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us and it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratingsi would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone
one of the finest biryanis i have ever seen my favorite biryani rather than paradise or pista house very tasty food and good looking restaurant
i have ordered egg fried rice and some roties from here at night 11o clock the food was okish i dont know if i ordered in time roties were also not that much good
i ordered chicken biryani online zomato delivered it ontime but food quality was very bad honestly i doubt whether they are serving chicken or some other meat i had to thrown the biryani that they delivered very bad restaurant that i felt
not good
worst food received low quality rice was used egg fried rice was almost spoiler unable to eat worst experience ever does not recommend
its one of the famous restaurants in hyderabad for hyderabadi biryani it serves several non veg items this restaurant is quite crowdy its a good place for family lunch or dinnerinstagramcom
it is completely biryani house you will not get satisfied every time but u cant find these type of biryani in hyderabad very crowded place have to wait much time to get a seat ambience is below price is very low when compared to other restaurants

the ordered veg biryani was without vegetablesi dont understand how this is called a veg biryanithe quantity is good matching to the cost
great food okayish ambiance decent service exactly the place you want to dine with good ol friendsthe likelihood of finding a parking spot during weekends is slim to none
one of the best biryani restaurant in hyderabad kebabs and other mughlai dishes are also delicious highly recommended for all nonveg lovers
visited this place on 24 march 2019 as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there we went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there but we managed one not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded such is popularity of this place lets find out how the experience wasambianceits a multistoried restaurant and every floor was full to the brim with several biriyani crazy people we got seated at the second floor the floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table the seats were well laid out comfy and spacious ratings 35 5servicethe waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food he paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help overall service was fine ratings 4 5foodhere comes the big deal lets find out if all the craze that this place generates is worth it actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended family pack chicken biriyani along with reshmi kebab and ginger chicken for starters the starters arrived and they looked yum the reshmi kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping made with the nonyolk part of the egg the kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth the ginger chicken was tasty as well must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces which was pretty filling for even four of us then came the family pack biriyani which was more than enough for even four of us we even had to parcel the leftover the biriyani here has a very different taste here its not that spicy but its delicious no wonder this place is so famous ratings 45 5value for moneyall these food for just thousand bucks need i say more pisa vasool ratings 5 5lets calculate rating ambiance + service + food + vfm 4 425final thoughtsif you are in hyderabad and looking for biriyani experience also soft and yummy kebabs then visit to this place is an absolute must highly recommended
ordered food via swiggy and got old and rubbery chicken of course it was stale and leftover stuff which was remodeled and resold shameful conduct never ordering again
the food was really bad onion salad was not served worst taste rahtha and the fish ordered smelled very bad i was completely disappointed with shah ghouse biryani
this is one of the best restraunt in hyderabadhere food is awesome and has perfect taste it also provides best service here i am visiting since 2016 and never got rid of the food
loved the chicken biryani totally mild spices well cooked rice 4 big chicken pieces but somehow got disappointed by the butter naan and chicken masala anyways heaven for biryani lovers
shah ghouse hotel did not deliver my order after making payment online zomato to ensure my online payment to be refunded as early as possible
our regular place to have chicken mutton biryani the flavour is awesome cant get the same anywhere most favourite is special chicken biryani the biryani will be completely different compared to the regular restaurants style
ordered chicken briyani and vegetables briyani its was good as usual if they could increase the paneer in the veg briyani that would be brilliant
please dont visit this place in the night if at all you are going along with your familyno service after 1200 as the zomato says its open upto 200complete missguiding and fooling customersim a fan of the biryani served herebut the staff the timings and the cleanliness over here is a clean bullshitbetter to visit the other branches like shalibanda and tolichowliplease dont visit this holy helli posted some pics just look at the table where we dine to eatyuck
i have ordered through zomato 1 chicken and 1 veg biryani and received chicken and egg biryani this is second instance happened i have thrown away the egg biryani and also the taste of the chicken biryani is not so good
most disappointing experience ever ordered for vegetable biryani during midnight hours from this restaurant delivery through swiggy was quick and swift but to my surprise i received only biryani rice absolute no vegetables or masala very bland taste too i do not understand why these restaurants cheats customers if they out of stock i would not recommend anyone to trust this restaurant
horrible biryani this is what we got when we ordered on swiggy it looks like you just want to make money selling biryani and left over pieces
offers one of the best biryanis in hyderabad also their irani chai is awesome both of them are must try youll not be disappointed place is little crowdy though
i had heard a lot about this place so i went there the dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins food etc i anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy but then i saw a rat nibbling on the scattered food i reported this to the manager and he told me its okay and ek do galti toh ho jati hai and they literally forced me to pay for my order which i did not even touch the staff was highly rude and it has been one of the worst experiences in hyderabad
original hyderabadi and ghee flavoured mutton biryani is my fav item from this restaurant and i am totally addicted to this dishbest quality too not 300 i am ready to spend 600 for a dish like this
food is decent and tastes palatable not the best though not very comfortable with the hygiene ambience is average service is poor good value for money if one can ignore the ambience and service
cant ever say no to this place how much ever crowded it gets or the time one has to wait to get a seat here biryani is simply amazing definitely among the best in hyderabad
the hotel never updates the status of the order i called zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order then the zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order next them mention it will be delivered by 111pm but again no update i called again at 115pm to check what happened to the order they again called the hotel to get an update then they mention your food is still getting prepared its in the kitchen what the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys dont mind to update or apologize i asked to cancel the order and zomato said it cant cancel as it will be waste of food great and i am stuck with the hotels will to deliver it or not pathetic service
good and polite delivery boy
just wow i placed an order for mutton laham special mandi it was really yummy they provide a bowl of mutton juice along chat pata tomato red chilli chutney with this dish must say it really fetches and satisfies your hungeri just say its a must try once for sure
my chicken was not boneless
went for team lunch on friday overcrowded and hard to get the place after 30 minutes of waiting got the table ordered tandoori platter and dum biryanichicken tandoori is roasted and spices are marinated well and biryani is worth for waiting remaining items are better to ignore roti and kebabs dessert kurbani ka meta is deliciouspros budget friendlycos long waiting especially on weekendsambience

i have been here quite a few times now this place is amazing the steward keshav was really polite and helpful and made sure we had a good experience the food is amazing
food was bad ambience was average i am not sure why this place is so over hyped no way its rating should be 46 will never go back to this place
the managers are so rude to the customers twice they declined the entry on two consecutive days we came here looking at the reviews but the behavior of the staff killed the mood they seemed bias towards the guests and prefer people whom they know at the entry
one of the best places to chill and drink in hyderabad the japanese fried chicken the kung pao chicken and the beautiful ice cold brewed beer we loved the weizen bock beer are the best ask for kamal who is simply the sweetest and the best server at the place he recommended the best dishes and the best beer make sure to ask for kamal when visiting otm cheers

when it comes to experience this is one of the places i ll remember for longwent on a saturday night and was welcomed with sweet latin music with people dancing in some latin form could be salsa or any other form considering they have so manydefinitely they were not the guests looking at their proficiency very good food not so great beer from their in house brews you will be shocked to see some healthy variants worthy try though overall a must go place for the experience
i must say the higly overrated placethere is very bad service from the team no one os really help to underatand the manu i really struglled tounderstand for veg and nonveh items similary for mocktails there is noproper detailsnot worth for money 1star from my side
if trying brewed beer is what you love to do this place is a must visit its has a very rustic and welcoming ambience one of their best beer would be the otm lager for starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when i say its one of the best vegetarian starters i had in a while the lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate the sauce is sticky sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors i would strongly recommend this dish as a must try also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture the chicken tikka was one of the best tikkas i had the meat was tender and perfectly cookedthe mint chutney was a perfect match to go withif you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work this would be the perfect place
its been always great to be at otm kaishav has been a delight every time great host highly recommended for food and drinks very responsive team and try to do whatever they can to make customer feel happy
best service ever sarveshvar rao did the best service ever i am so happy with his service and hospitality please recognise his efforts and wish him the best in the world
excellent place for hangout with friends nice ambience sarveshwarthanks for your service overall good experience keep music loud guys
this is good place to hangout hospitality of this restaurant is very good went to this place with bunch of friends had a great time and good
with great music and ambience the excitement for the final ipl match was enhancedthe food is great along with the exotic drinksmust try is the cock in the basket which is fried chicken breast
this place was on my hyderabad bucket list for a long time the ambience was awesome to top that it was ipl 2019 final the live dj was great coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of belgian brewed warning its a jug rather than a pitcher but thats the best beer i ever had the beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza both of them were outstandingthe worst part was the service the place is short on staff one waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table
over the moon name is not matching with ambience there is no roof top seating for this brewery outside seating was just average atleast the same ambience can be in the second are third floor service was very quick and fast because there is no other brewery in surroundings we can visit to this place
very slow service food was very cold and tasteless tables were not cleaned properlynot worth going again although ice tea was decent enough
great ambience the food tasted good as well removing one star because of lack of vegetarian options if they add more options before my next visit ill gladly revisit my rating
deepak sir the gem of all person hes the best anyone can even ask for any pub all over hyderabad come have some good times with this person service over the moon for sure
extremely delighted by the service by mr kundan indubitably one of the best brewed beers in hyderabad great service levels and ambience offered by this place
i have always loved this place but my recent experience was horrible even after booking the table well before time they gave me a table on 1 st floor with all stags around me the worst part was that it was a friday where they say they allow stag entries the service was equally poor
nice place to go to catch up with friends over a couple of drinks live music nights are really soothing and the ambiance is great service can improve in house brew collection is good but can add more variety to it since customers look for ranges thanks
i was really excited about this place as i have heard great reviews about the food so i went there with a friend to try out ambience its beautiful and so lovely and happening food we ordered irani chicken tikka and a mexican pizza the chicken tikka was a lil undercooked and also it was bland dint like at all the pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggiesservice its bad really bad might be the only reason i would not want to go again there are some great reviews about this place but my experience was not nice at all so dissapointed+1 is for the ambience
went for quick bite with friends and loved the place people were supper friendly and the food was awesomewe were so fullloved the chicken pizzafish fry andpalak tikalast but not the least the orange mocktail sorry dont remember the name was just awesomegreat job otm
in a nutshell otm has the best brewed beer ive ever tasted in hyderabad we tried moonlight apple cider and forscher all tasted amazingfood was good tooonly reason am giving a 4 and not 5 is the air conditioner for some god damn reason was not effective enough be ready to sweat we had to remind waiter who was attending us constantly to keep it cooloh yes no surprise world famous kundan was serving our table so no complaints with the serving parthe did well serving us
this place never missed to surprise when it comes to service5 star will be small i would like to add more starsspecial thanks to kundan for amazing servicelite was the best in hyderabadfood is awesome must try veg spring rollonce again thanks for service kundan
awesome restaurant with responsive people and food tastes great personally peri peri chicken fry is the most liked dish by me from this restaurant

been to otmbc basing on friends suggestionkeep reminded that stags r not allowed to ground floor may be on weekends disappointing but we made our minds to get onto first floor gracious ambience nice music and courteous staff multiple options to try from their brewery and food was ok recommended place for hangouts with friends
this is one of the classier places to party in hyderabad they have great music usually on fridays and saturdays when the party fever is high on sundays though its a bit mild relatively the food is good and drinks are even better go there to have a good time with friends
great finger food and drinks and a extremely friendly and attentive staff the main course options are a bit limited for vegetarians but whatever is available is goodmy personal favorite is their infused drinksfor a micro brewery they are quite kids friendly
firstly the seeating space is less and the music for garden seating is really bad some of the items in food menu were good but my mood was dampened by the extremely bad service this not a place to spend more time or chill
weve been here a few timesa cool place to hang out both with frns familybeer battered fish is jus awesomeon our 1st visit few months back weve got couple of lemonades as a complimentary toooverall a 5star experience
absolutely loved the food and ambience special thanks to keshav for the wonderful service should try their signature vegetarian starters
overthemoon is extremely lively place with great music and tasty food ambience is quiet spacious they have wide range of their own brewed beersat the beginning i was disappointed with services but they made it up with their top servicesa very decent place to hangout with your friends for some quality of timerating 45 5
extreme lively place with great music and great food i was disappointed at the beginning with their service but they made it up with their top service later on pizzas are good here so is the brewed beer
located in gachibowli this place is a perfect place to unwind on a weekend loved the ambience both outside and inside staff is courteous and prompt they serve good variety of draught beer and is must tryrecommended
this place was decently crowded for a thursday evening ambience was nice and with the perfect music on it just added life to the whole setupcoming to the menu they have good amount of beer options to choose from we ordered apple cider beer and it was amazing and from the food options we ordered three cheese mushroom and california chicken pizza both the items were good it was great experiencealso i would like to give shoutout to keshav for his prompt service
ah otm what can i say this is a beauty of a spot a cold beer and otm make for the best of timesditch the usual choices and try out their inhouse specialities you will not regret it bringing the microbrewery culture to hyderabad this place is a must for anybody looking to chill beer and eat all the same time plus they have games so head over there and let your hair down a little i would recommend this place over and overps try out their apple cider beer itll blow other beers out of the water
restaurant ambience is nicefood is tasty and cost is reasonablestaff is politethey offer 45 different varieties of beer and it tastes amazing
been here for the first time the food and the beer was great had ordered the white high pitcher mutton kheema kothu parotta basil chicken tikka and three cheese mushroom the beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste the kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly the mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element our table incharge keshav ensured that our orders were on time and we had a pleasant experience kudos to him i highly recommend the place for the food beer and ambience
superb place awesome place awesome drinks and foods the management and the stuff are very courteousgood customer service they know our drinks and food before we can order thats the amount of customisation this place offersnirjan was our server and he was absolutely amazingoverall a 5 star place for dates friends gathering reunions and a lot more
loved the food and ambience the staff was very courteouswould like to recommend our steward makhan extremely helpful and courteousi had ordered devils own cocktail found the taste little confused probably you can work on the cocktail taste my husband had ordered beer sampler and a glass of stout beer later which he enjoyed so no complaints on beerkeep the good job going
place to hang out with your friends soothing music and great service loved it completely variety of beers and munchies goes great with beer
superb service and awesome food nice place for friends and family good ambience with a lovely music friendly staff creamy mushroom is too good
this place had become our friday evening mainstay in hyderabad food is awesome and the brewed beer is a must have usually we have apple cider along with burmese parcel which is absolutely amazing service is also really good
decent place we went there on a saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid this one didnt let us down we ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling we couldnt eat anything more also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer decent enough also wanted to try the moonlit one but were sad to know that it wasnt available service was the best over all things said above mr sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give the sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 35 only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway so that dropped our moods and spirits a lil wish the restaurant had it going till the endambience 35 5food 4 5price 35 5service 5 5
nice place and food is outstanding service is very good american ale is very good vietnamese rice bowl and boti kebab tastes authentic niranjan service is very nice
actually i struggled between 3 and 4 for this place where drinks are so good and buffet doesnt last to it but a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best a little costly caution if you are a stag majority of times they wont allow u on ground floor in evenings which is kind of sucks though finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive
the customer service was very bad we ordered lobster and they served us prawns with lobster shells after a lot of argument chef accepted that yes we add prawns but as per me there was no lo aster meat also everyone from waiter to manager were telling different things
it was an awesome experience the staff specially kundan was really kind and attentive beer was really nicethanks for the great experience
a good place to hangout with friends good ambiance good food great musicalsp good outdoor seating staff was very well and polite kundan served us very well and was very professional
awesome place to hang out at kundan provided great service must visit try the food especially chana dal poori soothing music and nice ambience
i went with my friends the apple cider beer is a must try in the starters the 3 cheese layer mushroom the burmese wrap is also a must try in starters pizza was good the crust could have been little crunchy pasta was ok ambience is nice the dj did not play the latest songs but the floor was filled with people the waiter sarvesh was courteous
do ask for makhan if you visit great service good beer fermentation smell can get some people uneasy but beer lovers will surely appreciate
lit ambience loud music and great beer apple cider is probably the best in town service is a little slow coz of the large croud perfect for an outing with friends on weekends
ambience of the place is amazing with good music they have three types of seating arrangements inside lobby and open space all options are good book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends hospitality of the place is also very good they serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded they made sure to ask about the experience of the customersapple cidar is one of the best brewed beer i have ever tasted the alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter must to try at this place froscher is another good brewed beerveg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach corn and cheese it was served with three different kinds of dips one of the dip was spicy one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all north indian food lovers though the naan wasnt chur chur it was plain naan paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of north india the best starter was burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce it was extremely good in tasteif you are in hyderabad i will highly recommend to visit this place
parthu was awesome towards my guests he gave me the service i was looking forthank for your warm service which is beyond and above what i excepted
such nice place to hangout with friends with live music and enjoy the brewery drinks and waiters were so friendly and approachable cheers
one of my favourite breweries to visit in hyderabad great music and ambience ask for keshav he is super attentive and will ensure you have the best time here
otm food awesomelager awesomeambience awesome i am frequent to prost and any place which can be at par with prost is you guysonly one area where you can improve is your staffingupskill them as what all do you have in your menuwhen i asked them suggest me the best risotto you have then he quoted sab same hai like kichdiso hope you look into it and add cheese cake in your dessert menu the proper one
if you are a fan of brewery u should visit this place i have tasted three of there beers they taste good food is very nice we ordered chicken and tandoori fish style murgh everything is perfect here serving is also fast zomato gold is additional bonus i felt they should allow stags on weekends on upstairs at least with a entry fee rest everything is perfect
awesome experience and courteous treatment from deepak a great hospitality manager and his team great place to spend your leisure time thank you otm for all you do for your guests
awesome service food and drinks especially the lunch concept if pretty cool here love keshav for his service and hospitality try the lager beer
the place and ambience was goodonly sour point was our waiter kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well i had zomato gold membership and showed him the sameinstead of taking a photo of the same he started surfing the phone when i objected he denied checking the phone though the food and place was good the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude which cost the two stars
nice brew to hang out serving us really fast should thank partho for it next to highway is the only the negative stand for this limited choice for vegetarians nonvegetarian is really good
excellent food and service niranjan and karunakaran made our daynice tender chicken and german wheat beer uttar wonderful place for hangout
the place is awesome ambience is great food beer is just the best and the best part is service especially niranjan guy is very kind and polite
went here to catch up with a friend very near the orr entrance and right beside the main road the interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there the seating was plush and comfortable the choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely the preparation and plating everything was about perfect but we did not liked the lemon soda it had some weird taste in all it was good
over the moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from we tried the apple cider 3 5 stout 4 5 and two others think one was called moonlit 5 5 which were pretty good the food was superb as well we had the burmese parcel 5 5 nachos 5 5 french fries 2 5 prawns 5 5 chicken kebabs 5 5 chicken poppers 5 5 and mutton kebabs 5 5 the place jas good music and later in the night people can dance overall an amazing experience in hyderabad which seemed to cover everything
makhan provided really good service must place to go must try is belgian beer and stout chicken platter is good and fries platter is good to go for vegetarian
one of the best restaurants visited till date in hyd the have amazing ambience delicious food and extremely courteous staffthey are pro at making all the different delicacies and try to make sure that the customer walks out satisfiedit is a must visit restaurant and has amazing north indian food specially dal makhni and paneer butter masala the desserts are also amazing all in all complete value for money
special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare dinner last night at fishermans wharf was one such memorable experience spread across an acre with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast we choose to sit in one of the mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniturenow coming to the food started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best i have had in recent times chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla icecream to complete the meal the setting food and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us after redemption of the zomato gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child
undoubtedly the best restaurant in gachibowli get a fresh fish masala you will love it for suresit at the roof top and enjoy nicenbreezy air and feel of goa

visited this place about a month ago and they werent very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out asap they were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food tried the fishchips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent
one of the best fine dining restaurant in hyderabad superb ambiance and great service i personally loved the place and the way they treat tried spring roll tempura squid drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao fish tasted awesome overall starters were great and you will not be disappointedcoming to main course tried mixed veg pulao and dak bungalow chicken pulao could have been better one more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulaooverall one will enjoy the ambiance and food better to have a reservation during weekendsambiance5 5taste4 5quality and quantity 4 5service5 5presentation4 5

goan food at its best this place is as good as its sister outlet in goa mimicking the goan ambience this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experiencethe food had great flavours brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds the southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight great lighting and courteous stafftried the south indian fish curry and rice probably not the best ive had but all the other dishes made up for thismust try masala fried prawns kadhai jhinga mutton xacuti pinwheel delight mushrooms would give it a 45 5 just because of the prawns
the ambience is really good the food is good and especially the starters are delicious butter prawns were the best we were given a great service by mr naveen would definitely recommend this place
one of the best places to chill in hyderabad after a long weeks hard work love the place the ambiance reminds of goa and the food definitely yes i love the prawns and the sea food especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn balchoa the drinks added for the flavour i would recommend for a nice evening but check the reservations before hand the first time i went had to wait for more than 25 mins service is great overall a 5 star rating
good for a nice sunday brunch the buffet for two is 1500 inr and worth the deal id say the ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options would recommend
this place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling designed to make you feel like your on vacation it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation we had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourfulmushroom tonak and mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well it is the place if u want to try goan cuisine
perfect place for corporate dine outs had a great time with my team dinner wide variety of goan dishes and other food as well as beverages a bit expensive but ok the private space was good at margarita lounge
overpriced coming to the weekends they doesnt make the food tasty fish was not good there is no flavor at all i the food and 3 only for the ambience
the best place in hyderabad ambience is par class food is nice and service is always nice i love the live music too i love love love it crowd is managed well

lovely location and really a vast place great ambience friendly and courteous staff great sea food loved the crispy calamari decently priced
too costly tastes just ok and the service people dont have any manners also i have zomato gold and i went there as we are going to get free starter they started treating cheaplywarning never go with zomato gold they will throw cheap looks and treat you cheaply
wonderful ambiance one of the must go places in hyderabad good food however reduced one star coz they have stopped their brewery and serving draught beer
ya i started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy yum and many pieces were given toothis hotel is famous for sea foodthought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in india tooi felt like limited edition of varities are a available herethen my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280this hotel gave a goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music toococktails and mocktails are available toothe waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures alsoambience 5 5food 5 5service 5 5cost is resonable
one of my favorites in terms of seafood variety and ambience they have snagged the goa charm pretty perfectly we loved the prawn butter n garlic the best love to try their bebinka definitely recommend a revisit
this place is really good n relaxing because of the ambiance loved the place food was good its worth giving a try live music is an add on to this
went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet the place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either ac or outside because of the heat we went inside the starters and soup were served on the table there were numerous starters and it was very good the starters actually make you full the waiters were very friendly and helpful they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated the main course was good and there was a huge spread there the best part was the desserts which were awesome next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience
great place to have seafood in hyderabad goan style beautiful ambience lovely live music must visit place for food lovers overall great experience will visit again service was quick and friendly
very bad
the ambience of this place is amazing as the place is usually away from the city theres a sense of calm wanted to try seafood in hyderabad and i guess this was the best place availablethe only complaint is they have buffet lune up till friday so the options for weekends are usually limited
been to this place couple of times but finally found time to share my reviewgreat ambience with tasty food more of the chicken was delicious and juicyone should also try the fries of this placewould recommend people to visit this placebest time to click photos at this place would be sunset time and want to hear good live music then the weekend is the best
beutifull indoor and outdoor sitting delicious foodwe ordered man how chicken soup okloose prwans was good crispy chilly pork so yummy service is good
bad for a sunday lunchthe place might be good for evening ambiance but afternoon inside the closedmost ordinary rooms with no music just chatter of other guests is a mood spoiler extremely slow service food is tasty and thats the only reason one could visit the place
all kind of food is good here wrt al a carte go for famous dishes here eg crispy chicken not a disappointment for experimenting either dish of the day was not up to the mark sometimes pricey for regular visits
absolutely loved this place highly recommendedfood delicious exotic hygienic we tried lobster prawns and red wine we wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available maybe they should keep the menu items in stock you may not get all the items listed 10 10ambiance beautiful live music great lightening for parties and a nice dinner 8 10service satisfied they prepare food just like you would like it asking for instructions waiters were polite and nice they served us cake as we went for birthday celebration it was just a pastry but still nice gesture 8 10
the ambience tells everything the place reminds of goa the must place for dinner the food is tasty and they should try the goan delicacies
waste of moneythe worst place nd the waiters was not cooperativewe have to call nd ask them to bring the starterzero starone of the worst experience ever had

if you love goa this place is nostalgic it has sectons divided with the names of places in goa like panjim colva baga etcyou dont need to give a second thought to the ambience at all its perfect for a date or a groupgood place to have corporate partyfriendly stafffood is awesome veg as well as nonvegmust try chilli paneer nachos fried rice chilli chicken prawnall the alcohol they mention in the menu is available so not to worry for that even the beerscocktails to try mojito cosmo mai tai sangria these are what i tried and they are best
had been here a couple of times nice ambience lots of place to sit courteous staff members wil want you to visit this place again the food is also nice i think we indian restaurants should start asking spice requirements so that we dont end up getting spicy food
i love sea food a lot and there are wide number of animals to eat great ambiance friendly staff a non vegetarian will enjoy this place for sure liquor prices are not goan prices
fishermans wharf is basically goan themed restaurant with a huge seating area they have outdoor seating facility as well as indoor seating arrangement they also have buffet area pub area rooftop area etc the ambience is beautiful now coming to the food we orderedsteamed rice jeera rice zaffrani paneer tikka recommended dal fry chicken butter masala recommended mixed veg virgin mojito recommended ice golathey have a wide range of menu from continental cuisine to indian cuisine quality of food is amazing the staffs here are cordial service is fast the price is slightly on the higher sideambience 5 5service 5 5food 5 5price 4 5i would recommend everyone to visit this place with your loved ones and spend some quality time here i am pretty sure that you will not be disappointed
been to this place today for team lunch and this is my third visit my experience from this restaurant is that never opt for buffet go for a la carte you will not regret
food 4service4ambience5this is on the list for a long time and checked it off well its an goan themed restaurant and they nailed the whole decor coming to food we went at 530 pm so not much of a choice in menu so ordered fish fingers and chicken starter both turned out good will definitely try again
the place is open seating gives a good airy feeling music is good and it had occupancy on a week daywe ordered catch of the day lobster pomfret fish was very ordinary the lobster was done well main course was super prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours the star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like palak paneer at the first but had a distinct goan flavour spice on the higher sidenice place i would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day
this has become my go to place now we went on a sunday evening and really had a very good time with some delicious food and the band performing was also very nice we ordered stuffed crab and i would say it is a must try dish it was just mouth melting in main course we had goan prawn curry and rice and it was good they also have fresh catch counter where you select and customize your sea food
it has got just awesome ambience must visit place for sea food lovers the live music adds to elegance to your moments the food quality is amazing the staffs are polite and kind
went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try during lunchtime the place had few patrons but the service was good we took an outside seating ordered a nachos platter chicken drums of heaven tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken accompanied with butter naanthe nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese the chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste the chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy we really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside overall the dishes were a must try with a large menu and varieties i know ill be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish prawns and lobster fareambiance 5 5service 4 5food 5 5value for money 4 5
dun bombard the menu with so many things great hospitality and tasty food is what makes a place happening not coming to this place ever again
this is my third visit to the restaurant and surely im going again its a huge restaurant with very spacious seatingthey have outdoor seating indoor seating bar area buffet area roof top area its pretty huge placeand every bit of the restaurant is amazing ambiance is spot onwaiters dress code is good too service is amazing they have perfect knowledge of what they are servingand always ready to help dinners hospitality is awesome but only one washroom is a mehcoming to the foodi tried many dishes like thai green curry butter garlic fried rice stuffed crab fish and chips alfredo pasta cheez garlic breadi order thai curry every time i goit comes with rice its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistencyit tasted different all three times i tried it was good but different consistency mattersstuffed crab is amazingoverall must visit resturant its a expansive one but worth the visit i sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go
this place has good ambiance but i had a weird experience with food the menu drums of heaven mentioned chicken wings but we were served drumsticks instead upon enquiring the respective guy tried to convince us the drum sticks are drums of heaven when we had to show him menu and explained the difference for crying out loud he said there is a mistake in menu and went next u guys be the judge
we have visited the place for thursday dinner buffet and kindly do not try it they have very limited options of starters and the choice of spread was really poor even the selection of alcohol was very basicservice could be much better in the buffet section as the drinks order need to be provided overall its a total disappointmentfood 2 5service 3 5ambience 4 5kindly do not try the evening buffet as its very bad
ive been there with my girlfriend on a weekend the ambiance was soulful a bit expensive but the food was too good the staff could be more professional and my girl enjoyed a lot i should say hitting the gachibowli road for long ride do stopby there

the ambiance and setup basically the theme is just superbvery cordial staff and efficient toothe highlight is of course the food try the fried squid and butter garlic prawns a bit expensive but worth itmusic is a little over the top and unpleasant at times
food wasnt up to the expectation friendly staff the ambience was really good live music was very soothing would definitely visit again overall thumbs up for replicating goa experience
this place is good for your friend and famlilythey have good variety of appetiser their service is very freindly i have visit twise in this hotel and also seafood verity is superb the dj was also great my over all experience was very nicethakk you

i never knew i had such a great place near my home to chill out on weekends has really good beer non veg starters good ambience and quick service and the best sea food in hyderabad
very slow service it took us more than 25 hours just to have dinner totally disappointed with respect to the amount of money they are charging
wonderful ambiance and staff were very pleasant the music and food was extraordinary good place to hangout with all office family and friends
the best restaurant to chill out but food was surely not up to the mark chilly chicken too sweet they say 2+2 drinks but when you order cocktails they say it wont be applicable as they use 60 mlin that they should have told this before ordering fish is too good
every time i we visit this place it never fails to amaze with lipsmacking food a 5+ service with 5+ food taste keep spreading love and warmth through your kitchen to our stomachs
this place is a paradise for seafood lovers especially it gives you the look and feel of the west coast the ambience is something you can get no where in hyderabad a goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too it is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money the look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise this place is for friends family and your loved ones they have good variety of appetisers their service is very friendly they do have valet and ample parking space i have visited this place twice and i am so in love with the food and the ambience

i had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night while we were driving along the financial district road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work as we entered the place i was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating the place was already full by 9pm but we couldnt resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood thereafter we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then the food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds i would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you goa trips
i went to this place with 7 friends the ambience is really nice the staff are polite n friendly we had good time here food is really nice
surprisingly well versed ambience the place is massive with a getawayfromcity feel they serve wonderfully cooked seafoods goan focused a tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages i would recommend to book table before hand there are variety of sit outs to choose from i would highly recommend this place if youre a seafood lover
visited with family wonderful ambiemce and live band nice food and service by ranvir teja kiran and mukul friendly and smily thank you guys we will vist again sure
perfect for date nightsbeautiful place with great food and amazing cocktails especially there raspberry liits great options for both vegetarian and non vegetarians you can order anything from the menu and i can assure you it will be great the only set back is the service really slow just place your order in one go
been the place for lunch and i loved the ambiance over there which resembles the same as goa and the person who loves sea food will be attracted to this place
i love the ambience food is mouthwatering if you think you dont like coastal food do go here trust me food will get you there each time if you crave for sea food crowd is nice a peaceful place to be with friends or family do go there
sea food cravings close your eyes and reach this place in hyderabad a very wide spread variety of sea food cant pen it here coz you have to visit here i have always been here for the love for 2 things crabs and only crabs it is a must try speciality of the restaurant the goan preparation made with recheado masalawould rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied thats the fun of it ambience awesome staff too good feels homely love this restaurant more than anything 5 5 for everything
a must visit for sea food lovers brings in goa to hyderabad would love to see more seating arrangements in the open area great food and lovely ambience a must visit dont miss out on the simple yet amazing fish curry rice
ambience is really good lot of space laid back ambience mist sprays perfect for a lazy sunday lunch coming to food recommend trying only goan cuisine didnt feel the buffet was special or so but their ala carte is real good sea devil is a starter that stands out prawns wrapped in beacon perfectly grilled butter garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice chicken vindalho if you are looking for spicy or chicken xacuti if you want something less hot
great ambience great food i would recommend the pan seared fish its a little outside the city but the rooftop seating makes up for it
visited this place on saturday eveninghad stuffed crab fish starter chicken in goan style was very spicy stuffed chickenin drinks we had bull frog drink was strong and tasted goodwe went to have sea food here only one crab was available that is very big one ambience is nice i didnt liked the food muchthis place is very expensive alsooverall not very happening place
a place with great ambience and good food here you pay for the experience which is great and rearwould love to visit the place again soon
i had ordered gobi methi paratha it was ok not good it was too oily not much taste it tasted like it was a reheated paratha not fresh
food was good but it was all leaking from the plate and so quantity was very less as compared and i expected rice as well with the thali but it was missing
intially yes the food was really good they were maintaining quality standard of food very well which is rare in indian restaurant nowadays i dont see that happening thesetoday i have found hair my fit thali which shows how much hygienic they are apart from this so many times i have seen they miss on cutlery or few items i mostly order fit thali so i know very well what it consist of not just one time so many time items are missing
hyderabads most worst and ugliest biryani i had yesterday from the restaurant eat fit and this worst restaurant people not allowing zomato people quick to the destination delivery points it has been 2hr late i have received from the biryani from eat fit just disguised about the biryani of the eatfit alaasss this is a horrible biryani i had ate in hyderabad
very good at quality guyseven packaging is extraordinarybut chicken curry is not good which came more liquid with less tasteso quality quantity wise thumsupbut have to improve taste
thank you so much for the excellent foodit tasted great price quality everything good i ordered via zomato online app delivery package was also greatif there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great
order no 1127326452ordered rajma rice and what i received cold and badly smelly rotten food completely disappointedand zomato is not even helpful to resolve it
last time i ordered the food tofu keema wrap dal makhni and parathe from here i was delivered spoiled food the wrap was literally smelling sour and parathe were like they have been prepared in the morning and sent to us for dinner i always order from this restaurant and since it was the first time i wanted to ignore this but still putting out this review so that management can introspect and figure out if this was process fault delivery fault or a manual one
whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from it offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from indian continental oriental and even caribbean the food is prepared in a way that it is healthy but doesnt compromise on taste also the dishes are reasonably priced my only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly
i had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome healthy and tasty as well food quality was really very good i had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review i couldnt help myself fantastic keep it upp u have raised a bar do the good work always
i received food with a live green insect in it what food standards are being followed this is not expected from a restaurant with an excellent hygiene title
zomato please help me to give them negative rating to this restaurant i fell sick after eating their roti how awful it is if your food not good your packaging will not give u business
food was open
i ordered dal makhani with paratha the parathas were good so soft and tasty dal makhani was okit was tasting some different but it was good
very delicious millet and chicken dishi feel so good ordering and eating from eatfit bc i can see the nutritional value and no where else i have found this yet i love that they give a mini free desert too perfect sweet treat after a meal
till now ordered chefs special veg thali oat meal parantha in super breakfastpros# calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed# taste quality are greatnow i felt few things can be improved# delivery i felt it is slow and more than half an hour also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well# plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives# price and quantity ratio i felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providingeg oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds oats honey fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140 i strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20 so that they can get more orders and new customers to
great food no oil soft rotis tasty gravy and juicy chicken its a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals
we have multiple options to have food but thinking about healthier options there are very few i would like to appreciate all your effort to provide us an option to choose heathy and hygienic food great place to order healthy and tasty food
very less quantity and food taste also not gud
ordered chefs veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome 3 rotis paneer curry which had so many paneer salad dal makhani sweet everything was equally good and tasty ordered for the first time from this place and with all the discounts i paid just 61 for the food and got 50 as cashbacki totally loved it and would definitely order againquality6 5 i did feel i am eating homemade healthy foodquantity5 5value for money6 5packaging 5 5delivery 6 5it was a good experience ordering food from this placeps this experience is when i ordered from cult app later on when i order using zomato things were quite different like delivery was late no sweet
ordered lunch from this place the taste was good food wasnt spicy or oily packing was good and quantity was sufficient i would prefer to order again
the food from this restaurant was lipsmacking and packed with real flavoursliterally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asaphave u hv had this kind of feeling service was real quick comprising both order acceptence and deliverysuggestionsplz add cocktail onion with the mealportion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3 4 of the brimtu sum up this review i would say kuddos and you deserve ur brand name
they dont deliver your food they charge for food but may deliver only half of the order and when contacte zomato tell you that restaurant no is switched off strange are they in food delivery busines or this is something else beware
i ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for zomato to deliver zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but i am never going to order from this restaurant also the food was below average i ordered tofu keema roll
ordered a wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset the quality of food seemed really bad that time although i tried reaching out to zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eatfit team will get back till date i havent received any response from either zomato or eatfit
hey guys i ordered chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasnt a good experience at allthe only plus point can be given for good packaging but packaging doesnt count as we pay for good food the biryani didnt even taste like a biryani it was more like fried rice with chicken dumped had a very bad experience
if you want to eat something delicious without feeling guilty about eating unhealthy food then eatfit is your go to place delicious tofu keema parantha having no extra spices and perfect balance of flavors
for the first time tried the light lunch meal from eatfit which has 450kcal as mentioned decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil chapatis were homely soft and warm something a bit hard to get in hyderabad a less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier not sure if i would order this again but could maybe try their salads
why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry unless the buyers are foolsterrible pricing and quantity for the money2 stars just for decent taste of curryall those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you cant have sufficient food insideoh boy will never try btw the dish name is chefs special nonveg thali
forgot to give spoon and tissues
worst food i would never order from this again i ordered lucknowi biryani that turned out bullshittt it looked like timato chutney rice
eat healthy eatfit tried their nutty dates pudding and detox smoothie both were very good and it is good to have healthy food like these
we ordered 1 luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees the taste was okay strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani but i havent had lucknow biryani before so cant really judge how it exactly supposed to taste
ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me by bread omelette i was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate omelette tasted good bread was plain and hard there were only two normal medium sized roasted potato wedges it tasted ok along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato english style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down this was a major let down there was rajma type curry which tasted ok this whole dish was out of the way
delivery boy was reluctant to the deliver the order and was unable to navigate the maps he reached to different location and when i was trying to navigate him he said he dont know the address which was mentioned
dal tadka awesome rajma chawal soso too garlicky
food arrived wonderfully packed i ordered an omelette for breakfast and in the tray were also some beans small portions of bread potato wedges and roasted tomatoes a very pleasant eating experience though the omelette and sides were slightly cold upon arrival i might add for 160 rupees including delivery the meal was an exceptional value
ordered the breakfast combo from zomato the taste was good and simple feels just like home made food and healthy too the breakfast combo had a bread bun omelette grilled tomato and side curry kinda for the bun
i ordered from this place from zomato the amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant i ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes the juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml the potato flakes nothing more than normal haldiram mixture i am definitely not ordering next time
a 35well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaksso i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their chicken keem paratha wrap its was oily and tasted ok not bad at all it tasted just like a regular keema wrap busyes it came with sugar honey coated peanuts and some green chutney am not sure how it makes up the diet fit but yes a nice concept though
great hygienic and health food good packingall the ingredients look and taste fresh more importantly you get what you seei hope they maintain the veg non veg segregationa little expensive
food quality and quantity is not up to mark a family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 rs and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less no raita or salan given not at all worth for moneyquality is also not very good didnt feel anything great about worst place to order food sorry however thats the reality thanks
i found a small wooden stick in the tofu keema wrap i ordered from eatfit apparently not so hygenic and healthy as they claim themselves to be
an easy choice everyday among so many others for dinner not only is the food tasty hygienic and healthy their services discounts and the entire cure fit package is just amazing and a well deserved hype success
i had ordered veg pulav and egg masala bowl no egg and no taste pulav have no vegetables even restaurant took 1 hour to give it to the delivery boy this is ridiculous
ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again its very delicious i see that this time different type of oats wheat based are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher like the combination of oats sabza seeds and milk the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear cranberries besides apple dates pomegranate
have ordered from here multiple times but today the food wasnt up to standards ordered chefs special combo for 2 the salad and raita smelled bad werent fresh had to throw them away you folks have made a name stick to its standards
had ordered veg pulao rajma it didnt seem fresh however i consumed it couldnt sleep whole night because of vommiting loose motionwill never order food from eatfit again
super delicious nutty dates pudding simple dish made with wheat milk natural sweetener jaggery gud it was topped with almonds dates kishmish there was no cashew nuts as specified in menu else wouldve rated 5pomegranate protect was simply amazing one can feel raw pomegranate coconut juice satisfied with quantity for both items bought on zomato offer
fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing surprisingly its not what typical oatmeal bowls are oats soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear apple pomegranate dates and mint leaves superb taste enough for a personall eatfit drinks juices are amazing and so was guava glow could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon the pepper was unidentifiable in juice
less quantity
really healthy and tasty food quantity is a bit at the lower end for the given price hence expensivewould recommend dal chawal the sweet they as complimentary are really good should try to reduce plastic use in packaging as they are heavy on it due to marketing stunts
quantity too less for a meal
ordered chicken thali for two from here loved the effort they put in packaging and attaching printed labels of your name to the fooda wholesome meal for two it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each daal chicken gravy raita salad pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugara healthy alternative to oustide food if youre working out enjoyed the complimentary date tea cake as well
not valued for money
i strongly recommend this place for the folks who are conscious about calories i would suggest eatfit to look after the quantity because i think its very little with this price tag apart from this everything is extraordinary like packing presentation quality etcall the best eatfit
i have ordered kachori chana chaat for home delivery from zomato i was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eatfit previously ordered food quality being good as soon as i opened the box bad smell was coming then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachoris the chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachoris were also smelling bad i had to throw away everything i dont think i can order again with trust on their food quality
dates tea cake was good i was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates it was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthiertopped with chia seeds the lemon tea cake was surprising as i could feel cinnamon it was slightly oily at first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cakethese cakes are wheat based just as described which is a good thingthough the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes i wish it couldve been more just as shown in cult fit website
health consciously designed menu and quality food packing is also very nicekeep up the good work provides you a daily dose of health taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast lunch or dinner
eatfit is is the next level service witch can offer you the basic and simple food with all required proteins calories and energy and their packing is awesome
totally love the food the food tastes great isnt fried oily or too spicy just the way i like it has helped me check my weight also thank you what would i have done for my everyday lunch without you
i ordered tofu keema paratha and it was really good with the right measurable quantity of healthy and delicious food the food was perfectly packed
the taste was ok and food seems healthy for the prices that we have the quantity is way less doesnt fill half your stomach overpriced worthless
chicken was goodmix veg is very sweetand small roties
eatfit you beauty if theres one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong it has to be eatfit outletsi have ordered tofu burji and lacha paratha for breakfast this morning there was also yummy tomato chutney apart from burjiif you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free tasty and with great packing it has to be this placeeatfit provides you a daily dose of health taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast lunch or dinneri never ever ever knew healthy food can be so tastyorder now
ordered this delicious healthy dish massaman veg curry and thai rice bowl loved it curry is so smooth and contains everything as described in the eatfit menu
everybody is talking about eat fit these days i was curious to know whats causing so much buzz so i ordered chefs special veg thaliit contained 3 wheat flour rotis paneer ki sabzi daal makhni salad pickle and a healthy desserti really liked the way the daal makhni tasted it was tough to believe that it did not contain butterpaneer ki sabzi also tasted good the paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hungerbut i would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut the cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch also i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrotoverall if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape eat fit is a great choice you get calorie count protein carb fat count you can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days rest days accordinglyits great to see that people are so health conscious now eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution hope they keep inspiring us
very poor food and my items were missing
i had ordered chilly chicken hakka noodles it taste good chicken pieces are well seasoned and juicy iam impressed with the presentation taste would have much better it not taste like real chinese cuisine but i recommend to try atleast once
healthy food calls for eatfit good packing and decent food price is a bit on the higher siderotis could have been better will definitely order more from here
avoid this place is a scam if there is even a place i cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address anyway i ordered a healthy chicken breast dish they claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos then you get regular oily fatty suspiciouslysaucy indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand the only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion no wonder it is low on calories you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites there were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it maybe 25gr total submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce i doubt it was even grilled it looked and tasted more like it was fried although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows the picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only plus the sides on other plates i should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but i was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food at least it wasnt too expensive but definitely not healthy not cheap and not good quality food
can you explain how spicy food is healthy in addition to this the chapatis were super dry and both vegetables were tasteless not worth the wait and money of course
the food was amazingly delicious i ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious
i wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around gachibowli i did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eatfit was my saviour this was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in india few reasons why eatfit is better than other places 1 they do not use any processed ingredients 2 they do daily sourcing of veggies meats thats the real secret for the consistent taste 3 they use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 4 no maida no sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 5 daily cooking they cook a limited number of portions and there are various other reasons as well the calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the indian meals are very tasty especially their no cream dal makhni nilgiri chicken hyderabadi chicken mangalorean chicken kashmiri chicken tawa subzi paneer gravy in chefs special veg thali to mention a few not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day the healthy desserts smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos wheat chicken momos chicken baida roti are filling these help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the eveningthe only downside for me is that its a zomato exclusive and zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery they promise to deliver the food any time between 30 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour by the time food arrives its already cold which i hate personally this happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location the algorithm being used by zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless zomato needs to check this and also eatfit management also should take some actions against zomato they have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on zomato exclusivity many customers are disappointed verdict taste 45 5packaging 4 5vfm 45 5overall 45 5zomato delivery 1 5
frankly speaking this is my 5th order and many more to comehygeine5 5taste5 5quality5 5very impressed with the out of box concept of a superfood served with all items keep it up
overpriced crap on the name of healthy food the food industry has become a dark business nowadays looting customers on the name of healthy food quantity is too less at the price they sell
i have been wanting to have food from this place since a while as it had a good rating and reviews as well and the main thing here is healthy food unlike the other restaurants were we wouldnt even know how many calories we are consuming and i was thrilled to order food from this place so i ordered vegetable pulao brownrice and egg white masala curry and let me tell you it tasted yum and the packing was excellent damn i guess im gonna be quite regular in ordering food from here now
excellent food everytime i order just love the way they present their food and the freshness nd nutrition it has perfect food place for fitness freaksss keep up the same honest work you givekudos
you need to improve your packing had ordered veg thai green curry with rice by the time it was delivered to me curry had splashed all over the container even leaking from package zomato delivery person said it leaked while getting it had second thoughts abt whether to consume it or not
its really difficult to get tasty healthy food eatfit is kinda solving this problem food quantity is good display of nutritional facts made me happy i know what i am eating and can plan my day if following a dietordered chicken peanut curry woktossed millet bowl gravy tasted good with mix of veggies quality of chicken in the gravy is less than normal portion millers were kinda dry overall good experience for me
great place to order decent food have ordered dinner from them on multiple occasions the taste is definitely great especially their exotic chicken dishes the indian menu is also very satisfying have developed a deep liking for their date pudding its great comfort food the food is not oily and doesnt leave you feeling bloated
the berry blast smoothie tasted very good could actually feel the taste of papaya watermelon blueberries etc and can even make them out the quantity was a big disapointment the bottle was thin as well the smoothie was finished in few gulps
taste is not good and also not freshly prepared it seems food was cooked at afternoon and delivered during evening for dinner also not spicy
highly recommend this place the entire menu is so captivating and pleasing at the same time with a thought left in your mind that yay dont worry you are eating healthy and the food literally looks healthy no excess oil no hints of butter etc its simply delicious and perfect i tried dal makhni paneer curry masala chaach and tofu keema wrap all were fantastic in order of my mention
i ordered thai chicken rice first of all it is on the expensive side second the quantity wasnt good third it was spicy seems like they are spending more on fancy packaging than the actual food
not tasty
ive ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl and it was delicious and it contains green apple and basil seeds and pomogranate and banana and also dates its the most healthiest diet that one could ever have in an affordable priceit tastes delicious and oats taste good if youre on diet and want to choose a perfect oat meal this is the best one that youve ever asked for keep it up guys
i have ordered for one item oat meal and received another item ghar rasma veg pulao which is not satisfactory and wastage of food and money
it said thali but not adequate quantity
an awsumm place where u can order variety of healthy food strongly recommended to try everything on the menu as it is healthy fresh and hygienic everytime its ordered u dont have to worry about the caloriesevery dish comes properly labelled with its nutritional value so you know what youre having
ordered the paneerdal combo for 2 people it comes well packed in a big box the quantity of the food is great 3 chapatis for a person raita dal makhni paneer salad pickle and super food supplement we also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake so in terms of quantity a 5 5 coming to the taste the paneer was soft the curry was well cooked and was tasty dal was decent probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind wasnt high on spices or oil the curd was fresh and good in taste as well loved the over all parcel
dear eatfit what on earth charging you 180 for this 3 rotis 2 spoons of veg curry enough dal and little salad with spoon of raitai am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness3 star is for taste and quality but quantity doesnt even meet expectationsvery poor
i ordered from eatfit and sorry to say the food was at all not good both taste and quantity were below my expectationsthe food i ordered was masala egg curry with vegetable pulao with order id 1676056120zomato delivery guy when delivered i realized that curry was spilling from the box when enquired he said this is packaging problemafter zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eatfit seems to be not bothered after opening the box the food was just half a bowl rice taste seems to be of very low quality bad service from eatit and from zomatomy first and last order from eatfit already uninstalled zomato overall very unpleasant experience
quality of food and packing is good quantity is less in the bowl my advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity wont be sufficient for an individual
great food came up with neatly packed and the delivery person was handled the package with care and delivered on time thanks to zomato to be a partner with this kind of great restaurant around us eatfit is unbelievable and marvellous food making and packing
this restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web pageand after a long hard work i found one contact through zomato customer service which was also wrongthis shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurantthey have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact numbermoreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from thempoor showi would give a half starhorrible experience with eatfit

eat fit surprised me the way they packed the food is really nice nice parota with good curry i recommend order from eatfit is worthfull
the biryani here is very delicious one should must have this biryani if they visit hyderabad you will compare all but this tops the chart in satisfaction
i have ordered khabooz normal which is with saladi liked the portion size very much i have never seen that much portion size in any other shawarma outletit was very much for me the taste was also goodwould like to try their other shawarmas
was surprised to know that sg runs a shawarma hub too all thanks to sg biryanis which made me order chicken special rumali shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it the delivery packaging taste and quantity was perfect trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy it came without vegetables and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end it is always best to have little extra mayo
i ordered their special chicken shawarma from zomato first look it was quite heavy for one shawarma the quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a qualityit is not at all good the chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also it usually stays open late night but dont order from here stillthe quality needs to improve a lotstay healthy keep eatingnot from herecheers
super taste and packing was nice this is one of my favourite food and we had with friends everyone gave same rating we enjoyed a lot thanks zomato
i bought food from them twice rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma both were good and tasty i liked the libby shawarma more and the rumali was also good but libby better the rumali was fat shawarma means the shawarma was mota the only concern i had was there was a lot of coriander leaves i should have given instructions the taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well totally i am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well
delivery review ordered a chicken rumali shawarmathe chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chewalso the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicyoverall it was okayishhad to throw away half of it as both rumali and the chicken were very chewygiving 2 star because they didnt add mayo as requestedoverall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city
shawarama from this place is like heaven no doubt we enjoy every bite from it try dry fruit chicken shawarama for sure thanks zomato and shah house for such mouthwatering dishes
while i am eating my food i get this in my food the steel wire it cut my tongue inside the worst experience while having my food i am suggesting dont buy shawarma from shah ghouse
delicious and timely delivery dont miss the roomali shawarmas im on a business trip to hyderabad and this shawarma kept me company while i worked into the night
if you want mouthwatering bites then this for you guys hyderabads one of the best shawarmarecommended spl rumali malai chicken shawarmalikespacked with proteinbalanced spicescreamy texturedislikeswaiting timeno dinein place
had tried chicken shawarma lukmi samosa veg puff egg and chicken puffchicken shawarma was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok it tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark overall didnt meet my expectationsboth lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation just the shape was different better to go for samosa instead of lukmi the taste was ok thoughcomming to the puffs all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery not a big fan of these
some pieces of chicken are totally uncooked raw and important thing i had ordered for two shawarmas and i got only one i dont know what went and whose fault it isone who delivered he was saying that you had ordered only one when i spoke with the person of hotel who answered my call said that it may be delivery boys fault seems that no value for customer queries
not very pleasant experience with shawarmas here was very tasty but got hard time digesting unpleasant burps until took medicine and it was not only me but my friend also experienced same
as in the name the shawarma is truly special and its more than the money it costs tastes heaven delivery is quick as wellso its the right thing to order if you want some tasty chicken to kill your hunger
i tried 5 highest rating shawarma places in hyderabad and this is the best + most filling place simply amazing the special rumali is the best
i ordered a chicken rumali shawarma just now from this place and added instructions in my order not to put that slimy greasy mayonnaise some of these places are famous for lo and behold opening the food parcel was the item with the awful slimy sickening mayo i had requested not to be added and i might add there was only meat and mayo no vegetables such as included in shawarma ordered from better places this was listed as special shawarma
the dry fruit shawarma is awesome and every time ive ordered two for my self and ive finished as well the only hotel i love in entire hyderabad is shah ghouse
one of the best places where one can visit to taste shawarmas and can get easily addicted just in love with your chicken malai special hands down
best shawarma near gachibowli affordable and worth every penny delivery valet was also very customer friendlyreally enjoyed every bite
i must say i did not expect much after trying a few so called famous shwarma shops in hyderabad but i think this one equalled if not bettered istah shawarma house the chicken pieces were cooked amazingly well loved the cream packaging could have been better
the shawarma roll had uncooked meat i got pieces of bones too im very much disappointed with shah ghouse spl shawarma the quantity may be sufficient enough but quality matters more if uncookedit is good for nothing
excellent to taste
late delivery almost after 30 mins
it was not the same like before there were big big pieces of chicken instead of cutting them into smaller pieces
good for late night cravings
authentic biriyani must try the platters its an old and good brand the service is not up to the mark given their confidence that people will come no matter how they treat customers the food will cool you down even if their behavior is not good overall okay experience
ordered special rumali chicken shawarma was delivered uncooked chicken with a soggy rumali roti not worth the name never ever gonna order
very spicy shawarma not for people like who dont eat spicy based on rating went to try but it was very spicy couldnt finish it and ended up having upset stomach
delicious shawarmas i tasted over here so try here once in life time especially i like samoli and khaliooz rumali is not so good nice nice
never seen any place that is so unhygienic and dirty place is so dirty i have no words never seen anything like this not sure how people order and eat here
yesterday i ordered dry fruit shawarma from this restaurant nd it disturbed my stomach so much at olden days it was so good but now they are giving worst shawarma i instructed to add extra mayonnaise but there is no minimum mayonnaise also chicken is so hard to eat cant eat iti informed about this to zomato they are not responding nd either restaurant not responding dont try shawarma here nd ruin ur health
one of my chauffeur in hyderabad recommended this place for authentic persian food and i was disappointed this place didnt live upto the fame and name the meat wasnt well cooked the taste was bland the service was fast however the quality of service was a disappointment a cold finger bowl at the end made it worst ambiance 0 5 service 25 5 staff 35 5 food 1 5 value for money 15 5
this place promises to be one of the good shawarma outlets in gachibowli drive down there for shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles so sit back and order online my order contained 1 shah ghouse chicken special rumali shawarma and i have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more filled with hummus and the chicken was just cooked right it is surely at par with the shawarma served at shahi dastarkhwan lakdi ka pul the search for a still better shawarma continues my 5 star rating is still pending for the best shawarma
i did not expect like this from shahghouse 1st time sharwarma with bunand it is spl and on the cover it s g is shahghouse or another doing on your name in onlineplease check and do better
for the first time when i has shawarma here it was great and thought of ordering it again but the issue with these kind of places is that they just serve good food until they are famous and once done the quality descends drastically the best shawarma i had is at sk shawarma dlf and other opposite to food bazar nizampet
chicken taste is not good
was a great having one of the best shawarmaeverything was just as perfect as it could have beenand specially try the the one shawarma with that malai onethat is the yummiest
i ordered chicken shawarma its a worst experience the chicken gets spoiled and smells we threw it away very worst experience stay away from this restaurant
not a great one and not a bad one either can try it once the packaging isnt great and it spill off easily give a try but dont expect too much
one of the besstt places to order shawarma this is a shah ghouse chicken special rumali shawarma the chicken is so tender and juicy the spicy shawarma with mayo malai hits right on your taste buds the quantity is filling and overwhelming i love this place and i do recommend this place to all my non veg lover friends great quality quantity of food keep it up wish i could give more than 5 stars
i ordered chicken shawarma from here suaces got leaked completely as you can see in pics packing was badzomato delivery was so late i dont it is mistake of shah ghouse or zomato delivery executive i thrower that shawarma bcz of itgenerally we get best shawarmas here but i had very bad experience of packing and delivery executive
excellent taste no replacement for shahghouse shawarma quantity is worth no delay in delivery with unique taste try once and without any doubt you will addict
delivered on time
ordered malai shawarma it was very tasty and mainly not spicy but when ordered for 2nd time it was very spicy but overall its good and one of the best places to taste shawarma in hyderabad
this is a restaurant provides a lovely juicy tasty spicy shawarma 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice i didnt do that thoughits a perfect shawarma
this place serves the best shawarma at the most reasonable cost everyone should try shawarma at this place the shawarma is totally stuffed with chicken the fattest shawarma i ever had
very poor food
very bad packing n itemthe restuarant rating 41 and the food was not matchingits so disappointed
although shah g is famous for its late night dine in facility the shawarma is pretty awesome too a shawarma with a single irani chai in the evening is so hyderabadi
badwe are ordered at around 5pm but thats delivered by 715pm
over sausage in the shawrma roll
i believe the food was spoilt because of which we fell ill that night
didnt like the quality seems like its been stored
one of the best shawarma joints in hyderabadthe quantity is enough to satisfy ones craving for shawarma chicken is tender and juicy and mayonnaise does its work like a charm with the chickenmust try special rumali shawarmaif you are a north indian and love shawarma then this the place for you chicken lollipop is also one of their specialities
been to this place plenty of timesordered special rumali and khubusfalafel is also goodvery busy andshould wait for sometime for the orderparking is hecticoverall worth a try
good service
just make lil spicy
so tasty and jucey and yummy
i ordered a shah ghouse spl shawarma from this restaurantthe chicken was quite spicy but the taste is goodeveryone can try it oncethe delivery was on time
reduced the quantity from before i hope they get back to the old times
shawarma at shah ghouse is very tastyi love to order it from shah ghouse onlyquantity of a shawarma at shah ghouse makes your stomach happy
every foodie i met in hyderabad recommended this shawarma i had just started loving the one from istahs but im up for a new challenge my friend ordered one and we shared it was awesome it was spicy and tasty then i ordered one myself but i ordered the one with salad what a slap in the face i came with cucumbers and almonds what the rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle nevertheless i liked the shawarma its not the best but its in the high ranksedit 1 yesterday i went to shah ghouse again i really wanted to try the special shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion to be honest i was blown its the best shawarma ive ever had the meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much i relished every single bite take a bow shah ghouse
if u look at the they make it u wont even try it but once u try it u wont forget it its aswum place is dirty and lack cleanliness and hygiene but taste is really gud and pocket friendly too
shawarma here is the best it tastes different from every other shawarma joint the way the chicken taste is just amazing dont know about biryani but if you are looking for an amazing shawarma experience you must try this
a very popular shop nearby the hotel i was staying in gachibowli just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big shah ghouse complex housing the restaurant pan shop tea shop and this shawarma joint lot of crowd and filled with online orders delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas amidst all this rush i ordered for a special rumali chicken shawarma for rs 120 got it in a jiffy and i havent had much shawarmas before this was absolutely delicious and filled with chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise sauces etc i guess i checked out the reviews here beforehand and i told them to make it less spicy dont be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling a somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack
best shawarma place in hyderabad quality and taste is too good eat to have best shawarma in hyderabad go to shah house very rush during night time
the best shawarma you can have is here the quantity and the quantity both are awesome one shawarma is enough in terms of dinner or lunch i always prefer to have from this place
food is good
worst taste i ever had
ordered special chicken shawarma rumali and special chicken shawarma samoli the taste is amazing and the quantity is also good and sufficient for one person the online order facility is only available through zomato giving minus 1 for oil and the amount of spice as the shawarma is oily and spicy but its taste awesome feedback for this great place would be to make it a little bit less spicy
goid service
waah kya shawarma manreally succulent chicken sweet flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti this is a fullsized dinnerreplacement wrap thats bangon with the flavours the only shawarma in the twincities worth craving for do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life let it be this and thank me laterps the chicken is on the spicier side though
rating 35 5although very little resemblance with the lebanese shawarma wrap the rumali roti shawarma tasted good the wrap has good quantity of chicken stuffings and the sauce was good too but once again the chicken was quite spicy so if you are looking for healthy food this shawarma isnt your call very fast delivery
shawarma is not tasty need to improve in taste
wrong item received
shawarma was really good and full of chicken but but but chicken was too much roasted and there was lack of mayonnaise which should be increase to make it feel like juicy
good taste
shawarma is not like shawarma its like rumali roti filled with chicken khorma or sweet roti filled with leftover chicken curry nd some mayo in a corner that you might have to search
quick delivery
late delivery
awesome before the time delivery satisfied
i got match stick inside shawarma
the best shawarma to have when in town i had a rumali malai chicken shawarma which was just right amount of spicy and well flavoured filling for a dinner
ordered khaliooz and samoli shawarma everytime the quantity used to be good now the meat was very less in quantity and quality doesnt meet standards
great
good
excellent delivery
nice
chicken in the shawarma is stale and stinking went to the place and was very unhygienic wont ever order anything from here shah ghouse quality is pathetic
you ppl always miss the curd and raita and lemons on biriyani order form this application please provide all the things along with food if you dont change this ppl definitely look your collapsing in soon
chicken shawarma is awesome but ordered veg falafel too with instructions not to put cucumber kheera because i am allergic to cucumber but have ignored it n made me fall sick also i mentioned extra mayoneese which wasnt there5 ratings for special chicken shawarma1rating for veg falafel

chicken inside the shawarma got spoiled and smelling too once opened it and was smelling spoiled before ordering only i thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time but due to the trust on shah ghouse ordered it and initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it i last order i thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday i ordered shawarma and he repeated the same food quality in shah ghouse getting bad day by day
man this place hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill eat and drinkthe food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite partwe tried almost everything on the menu perks of zomato gold and nothing really was a disappointmentthe place looks amazing and has a cost feel they have a setup on the balcony from where the view is just amazing
best place to be to hangout with your loved ones ambience and taste of food one no need to comprise on that friendly staff staff sandip very humble and understands your taste worth being there good value for money
the fisrt time i came here fell in love with the ambience the food is good and priced nominally sandeep was so helpful in choosing the right choice of food drinks
my peace of advice pls dont waste your money over pricy but buffet spread has very less items very much disappointed and the food was not even hot
had visited for lunch buffetto my surprise at 2 pm most of the dishes were hardly left and were not replenisedalso service is slow had to wait even to pay bill inspite of the fact that it was half occupiedhad much more expectations for that price rangedefinitly not value for money
food was not that great just ambience was good very very conjusted sofa area worst ac service was good but i dnt recommend this place for food
been here for my college farewell on a tuesday afternoon absolutely loved the ambience in food starters were amazing however main course and desserts could be better we booked the dance floor with additional charges and have to say we had hell of a time dancing to the dj absolutely customer friendly serviceoverall ambience 5 5dj5 5food45 5service5 5will recommend for partys with friends
visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and i must say one of the best places to party in and around kondapur the place is huge and divided into 3 sections interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balconyif you ask me can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony my favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the daywhen it comes to foodfirst dish was green veg galouti mince of green packed with galouti masala onion cashew paste and smoked with clove laung the kebabs are so soft that they just melt in mouth achari daal croquette achar flavoured daal puree rolls coated with panko crumbs and deep fried and the tomato chutney served with it just enhance the tastemoong daal cheese chilla minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa it was decentchole bathure the chutney was so good served with potato curry galoutis are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and mutton galouti is just perfect at hyperlocalhad few mocktails but my pick was kiwi based mocktail full marks for the presentationschicken tikka this can never go wrong it was very goodchicken taco will make it simple just loved itheard alot about desserts next visit will be desserts will keep you posted friends over all the experience was good interior might not be the best looking one still looks decent but the balcony i must say fell in love with that area
visited this place while ipl screening they were running couple of bucket offers on drinks and food ambiance is nice and you get the botanical garden view free of cost music is too loud for me we ordered one pizza and a chicken starter both were goodambiance 5 5music 3 5food 45 5service 45 5
good taste of food and nice ambiencestaff are really friendly sandipmusic was really good and atmosphere was energeticits good place to njoy with friends and family
pathetic restuarant i had to struggle even for getting a table once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle they messed up with everything i ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken i mean how can a restuarant do this after that i had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order it took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order it was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times on complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check and at last when i saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered horrible experience i wasted my money time and energy
visited this place on friday first of all i would like to compliment dj zain sabri for playing whatever song ive requested and the food was good the ambiance was perfect for me and my friends well surely come back
very fast deliveries quality and taste were very good be it veg nonveg njoyed the big screen music dance floor drinks food ambienceit was a ladies night on most of the fridays which makes the pub more lively as well you must definiely visit this on a friday night
good place to fun with your teamnice dj #zainsabriambience is goodcrowd was decentthere is a nice balcony to sit and enjoy ur drinks
one line #only4chicken ambience is good with large screen inside and nice atmosphere outside coming to food you will not find any item other than chicken for non veg and aloo for veg service is very poor i hardly see two people serving and cleaning can give a try only once with friends by going for early bird buffet

very nice and cozy place with good ambience food was also great staff was also courterous we were served by sandeep who happened to be a really polite and gentle person overall i would highly recommend the place
good place to hangout and party place is for party lovers can enjoy good food watch ipl and music staff is polite zomato gold is accepted
the overall experience was good just one thing i particularly didnt like it and it was tacos rest the order the ambience was really good
shame on the management dont even consider the regular customer benfit please do close it shame on you ppl please dont visit hyper local any time
i and my friend went here to watch the ipl live screening and have some good time one good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through zomato gold the food pretty decent too but what i didnt like was that it didnt have good options in drinks especially nonalcoholic we eventually went for masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad we asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldnt take it back wasnt happy with the servicealso the live music there wasnt great
love to be here again the way nitish has done a jobcant express in wordsi recommend each everyone to have a great timeherethanks nitish for giving your valuable experience with us
all services delayed menu changes very limited options in snack and food when asked they say its menu from delhi and cant help inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table asked for french fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in ok last one came finally when the manager arrived after being aggressive they want to offer free drinks but its not about money but experience will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back
this was my second visit to the place and i am very disappointed for the following reasons1 the first time i visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issuei dicided to give it another shot and came again2 ordered cheese chilli toast never order it its as hard a a rock cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread3 ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me4 dj was pathetic it was supposed to be bollywood hangover he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiters ear let alone having a conversation with your friendsps if you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good dj you need feel the pulse of audience
horrible food no variety wanted to give zero starshorrible food no variety wanted to give zero starshorrible food no variety wanted to give zero stars
just have been here for a team lunch they said they offer buffet and when we sit to eat its just one non veg starter and two veg starters when we enquire they say that sandwich is a starterlol and even the starters look like prepared for breakfast and served for lunch would never ever recommend this place for buffet worst experience would have given 0 rating if it existed
i really want to give nill rating but i couldnt because zomato doesnt provide option please note that this is the second time i went to hyper local1st time was my engagement party in feb2019 and we loved everything about the restaurant be it service food quality ambiencei strongly insisted my friends for office party so we went on may1stwe took buffet and that was the worst decision that we tookfirstly there was no food we requested multiple times to refill but they didnt at allnext service was tooooo poor they were not even respondingno plates no bowlsfood quality was worsewhatever the left over food they have in the bowl were not hotnote that i went at 130pm to restaurant fullyy disappointed for coming and wasting our day out
it was an awesome experiencethe staff specially nitish was really kind and attentive food and beverage was really nice thanks for the great experience
mr nitish is very prompt and an excellent services done by him very courteous great ambience we love the food and the drinks got screening was good
pathetic experience i have had in recent times arrived for buffet at 2pm i saturday afternoon the food was cold as ice no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customersthe only thing that was severed as per its level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experienceuntil raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was coldlater is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experiencewill not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as optionreally disappointed
follow me on instagram survivingforfoodheyy peeps was here for sunday late lunch this is my first time visiting this place ambience they have both indoor and outdoor seating as well indoor was totally chilled and relaxed place where we have screening going on any movies or songs as it is ipl season mostly we can get to see the match screening i loved the luxurious seating of inside which was so comfortable and we can lay back and enjoy our food my favourite seating was outdoor from where you can see the breathetaking view of greenary sky and sunset the best view while having our food i soo loved it i completely had a pleasant view and seen some peacocks as well rate was not too pricey they are minimal fooood green veg galouti never tried veg galouti so far always digged into non veg but to my suprise i just enjoyed this dish as much i loved the mutton galouti best 5achaari daal croquette stuffed with daal and enjoyed the crispyness of it 4chicken taco my most favourite taco loved it stuffing thoroughly enjoyed it 5moong daal cheese chilla it look alike taco but served with the moongdaal i never heard a dish like this but sometimes when you try anything new and you love it you definetly gonna try it back again 5cholebature droolworthy 5coming to the mocktails and cocktails the presentation was so amazing they come with such a unique names and confusing loved them 5service it was toooo fast i must tell you they just speed up and always available to serve and friendly too 5 hyperlocal hyd hyper local

review recently weve received an invitation from hyper local its on the 3rd or top floor of sln terminus gachibowli just next to platinum cinemas the place is located in a good open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer and if you go there before sunset you can enjoy the dawn the ambiance is pretty good withfull barnightlifelive musicprivate dining area availablewifilive sports screeningindoor seatingsmoking areabuffetif you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues this is the perfect place their food is pretty good with reasonable price i find the prices are on the lower side than any other nearby cafesthey are serving ipl live screening with bucket bonanza where you can get 4 pints of beer including a veg nonveg starter but you need to remember the entry is restricted to adults no kids allowedanyway yesterday i went to keep the invitation it was around 615 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday i asked to serve their specialty so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail first they served lsd which is a kickoff cocktail made with 5 types of liqueur like gin vodka tequila rum triple sec and made with freshly squeezed orange juice triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter sweet oranges and with the use of fresh orange juice the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well i was eagerly waiting for the mocktail thought of trying the nonalcohol drink first then the cocktail the mocktail was served along with chicken tacothe mocktail was made with fresh kiwi mint the flavor of fresh ingredients were significant made the drink so refreshing usually in bars they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really niceafter that i tried their chicken taco those tacos were made for indians so you cant get the blunt taste but the real fusion works here those tacos were stuffed with indian spiced grilled chicken and topped with mint raita and served in malabar ghee fried parotas taste wise they were so good but the only thing which bothered me the malabar parota as the parotas have layers so it was difficult to hold the entire thing so i suggested to use plain wheat four maida tortillas i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken and yes the tacos were too filling i could have only 2 of themnow its time for the cocktail which was literally inviting me to taste it and believe me it was kicking off so strong but nice orange flavored very refreshing i could only finish the 3 4th of the entire portionthe stuff were insisting me to try something else on food i left it on them so they suggested me to try their signature dish chicken sambousek what is that that is baharat spiced chicken keema cooked folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried served with 3 types of dip mayo mint raita sweet tamarind saffron chutney i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney it went so well togethernow you might be wondering what baharat spice is as per the chef the word baharat actually means spices in arabic and not a single spice but a blend of several spices in this blend you can find black pepper coriander paprika cardamom nutmeg cumin cloves and cinnamon so the chicken keema was cooked with these spices though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa but the taste was very different and thats why the 3 different types of dips were servedi felt the food quality quantity is quite enough satisfactory as per price definetly overall 45 out of 5already written about the ambiance 5 out of 5location is also easy to reach 45 out of 5service was a professional efficient 5 out of 5as per my experience young people have a great option for a bar cum restaurant which serves both quanlity quantity of food dink on reasonable price with nightlife live screening beautiful ambiance
they have worst north indian food i believe spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food but other than that chinese and continental was good their safe sex on beach deink is great just
monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have got being screened then things get better yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of got i had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails yes they have a new menu for that to try now they are fancier than you are i ordered for blood diamond bloody mary to start with which was different when they added dijon mustard you can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail the bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving my next cocktail was thyme of your life well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice now this drink actually gives you a kick in first sip itself the peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste i would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink coming on to the food after going through the menu for a long time i finally ordered the indianised version of pasta fusili in kasuri methi and coriander sauce the name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce it was full of medium size diced veggies like zucchini bell peppers broccoli and mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread it was good experience on my first visit the staff was courteous polite and very patient with their guests overall i would like to rate it 4 5 you should definitely try this place for hangouts
amazing place and best to chill out with friendsspecially the outdoor ambience we simply loved it as well as the food was also nice and along with the service
food is delicious and great hospitality too by sandeep would recommend others to come over here and taste the delicious dishes and friendly staff thanks all of you
nice place to hang out food was really good as well as drinks ambience and music was really goodloved the dj for friday night worth visiting the place
as here the food was good and they serve all the cusines chinese north and hyderabadi and buffet the chinese dishes were delicious compared to others can go with friends for hangout
went on a saturday night it was ladies night i enjoyed the feel ambience music and dance floor i wish there could be a better system for ladies night rather than queuing up across bar counter n shouting to be heard amongst over enthusiastic young ladies pushing you aroundfeel was just right n music was bomb danced till we drop
pizza is goodnice staffambiance good but better to visit night time to see the beauty of lightsplace is very quiet during day time
excellent drinks and some great starters suggested by the courteous staff superb ambience must visit for all and come long with family to have some good time
food 4 5ambience 35 5service 1 5i visited the place last week the food was tasty and so was ambience but i have serious concern with the serviceswe asked for regular water and they brought dirty stinky water just to sell the bottled water the waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for freeit was highly irresponsiblealso we had to literally beg them to bring the chequeplease train your staff if you want to
nice place for hangout and sevice was too great n server nitish is treat like as friendand his suggestions is very amazing so plz meet him before service
amazing place to chill live music and ambience is up to the mark food is fine they should include some options in mocktails and drinks overall a good place to hangout with friends
one place to order pasta when youre hungry in office also stomach filling with two toasted breads if your hungry want to order something quickly without scrolling down much just order it and wiat for the food
menu needs a major overhaul not for a large group of people not for everyone due to limited items in menu mocktails are damn expensive ambience not as good as few competitors
the place is within the sln mall in gachiwaliwe took the inside seatingthe ambience is petty collwe had couple of beer long island ice tea with chi 65 which is yami
there is a cafe named hyper local cafe in manikonda i dont know if this belongs to the same one but went to this place with certain expectations but was disappointedit has quite a good experience especially outside there is a nice setup leaving that apart food was not upto the mark had butter naan and two chicken curries which really didnt make me happythey can improvise and can work on the tastefood 25 5ambience4 5people4 5
hyper local is the perfect place for a saturday night for a party scene great ambience a dance arena with a good dj and a tv screen for those cricket buffs in d group they have everything for everyone the fries are a must try with the lavish assortment of drinks served here
the experience here was so good the managing staff were really polite to every single person the food was wayyy too good and the ambience was beautiful too had a lovely experience
a great place to have fun good food variety of choices grand menu caring staffwonderful ambience the best part i liked about the place in the use of space for marketing and customer handling everything is just superb staff were very polite and friendly
best place to party in town hyderabad gachibowli sln terminus great service good food nice ambience new place in sln terminus we had a great time with my friends outside area looks amazing thanks you so much guys team hyper local see you soon
i had the worst experience here on april 5th 2019 i came here with my friends they first served cold non veg platter however the worst came in when we ordered momos the container had three cockroaches running around we returned it immediately the music was pathetic as well we left the place as soon as we could
we liked the chhole bhature as it was not at all oily they serve good italian dishes as well pizza crust is baked well service can be improved
bartenders are very courteous and well behaved great place to hangout on saturday nightgood crowd and beautiful indoor and outdoor seating is availableservice is really goodstarters are good
they have this amazing ipl offer600 for 4 pints french friesnice ambiencea bit expensive otherwisethe view is really good spanning the whole city
oh my god what a horrible place they have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar and in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside they serve cocktails but i would rather drink water than those cocktails 4 of us ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks cocktails including lit a glass of ice and very little juice cost 650 sotb a glass of ice with a little of some another juice old fashion even smaller glass of ice with a slice of orange and pinacolada this ive no idea what they put for the white color apart from that it was bad juice again 3 of us were not even a slightest bit highall this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroomagain that being said when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me we had two zomato gold discounts when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was because its the highest priced drink did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer when i implored further the waiter went inside and got it correctedduring all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations i guess that too is the part of the cheating planbe aware people avoid this place
the drunch trend has picked up in hyderabad and hyperlocal has joined in toothe ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up the utilisation of the limited space is done well a good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun setmoving on to the food we tried the newly launched drudge menu priced at rs1200 this was an expensive affair however if you are early ie before 430 pm then you can avail the same drunch for 799they had a theme which revolved around delhi street foodthe drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks we tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint coolerthe buffet consisted of golgappe dahi bhalle sev puri bruschetta mini veg and non veg pizza dahi kachori chole bhature red thai curry with rice chicken tikka fries noodles and chicken tikka pocketsgolgappe sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste dahi kachori was a complete let downthe bruschetta stood out and pizza was averagechole bhature were okay but the bhature werent crispthe red thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a chinese preparationnoodles were randomly kept with no gravythe chicken tikka pockets were drythe chicken tikka was good and marinated very welloverall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didnt go together the idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesnt sound correctthe music was extremely loud for the placeoverall we had a below average experiencebased on the drunch menu i would rate it 25 5
been here with office colleagues overall a good place to hangout with a gang but the sitting arrangements during day time is very tight as people would want to dine inside rather than out in the hot sunthe food was excellent in taste the chicken dum biriyani had a very different taste and i loved it
the service captain roshan was very friendly and helpful to order non veg plater mutton curry and chicken biryani and drinks very good i am very happy thanks roshan visit again
lovely place with decent ambience the food is really good one of the best service in the city in hyper local roshan was really amazing overall ouder dahi kebab chilly paneer super spicy wings really very good thanks roshan will visit again

the place is good not the staff untrained few of the staff behave like we owe them some money and they are doing a favour for us even though music and ambience are good
we went for a birthday party we ordered the drinks the alcohol was very less so i called the bearer informed about my issue and guess what he said apke paise se bacardi or coke hi milega and drink was for 349 what i paid for that drinkalthough the manager was sweet enough to get me another drink
simple and elegant ambience polite staff food was really good especially the nonveg platter must try theme comfortable seating they really make the best and must try cocktails they just enjoy serving their new trials with cocktails served as complimentary for me when they tried it and the immediate minute its worth an order of it
its a decent place for dinner decors and the service is average but the food is good and the bar is fully loaded with great drinks and the offers are also very attractive
tried two places in same venue on saturday evening in hyper local first seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 630pmordered drinks and snacks spicy chicken wings very hot average taste 3 5 chilly cheese toastdrab dry 3 5 drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one i got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka after getting one when asked for plus one reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small now ok i can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks when told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billingpeople who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation good bye for ever
i had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place we were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation it separates balcony from the bar we told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing you dont have to worry about anything till that time we had ordered our food but seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out
we have ordered mutton galouti chholey calzone pesto roast vegetables pizza and penne arrabiata chicken the detailed review are as followsmutton galouti enriched with spices made up of succulent meat dont try if you dont like spicy foodchholey calzone a treat to the taste buds kulcha pockets filled with chholeypesto roast vegetables pizza a thin crust pizza with adequate amount of toppingspenne arrabiata chicken added separately nice cheesy pasta loaded with vegetables and chickennice ambience and satisfactory service

priced reasonably like all other cafes nearbythe food was good full marks for presentationthe service was greatthe ambience was goodall in all its a good place to hangout id rate food 3 5 thoughambience 4 5location 4 5
crap food less varities and no drinks in buffets not recommended at all not recommended at all not recommended at all not recommended at all
had a great time dining at hyper local the nonveg platter chicken tikka and assorted wings were very tasty all food our server for the day nitish kumar was very prompt and friendly
one of the worst restaurants in hyderabad very bad service and they didnt have most of the things that they specified on their menu card took friend for lunch there thinking to have good time but was one of the worst times
visited hyper local for their newly launched drunch buffet the buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200 per person the place itself is located in a good open area inside sln terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offermy experience with their food was decent the drunch layout comprised of north indian inspired starters such as dahi bhalle dahi vade gol gappe as well as papdi chaat i would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things my favorite of the lot was their golgappespeaking about their main course they had a really limited options consisting of chole bhature veg hakka noodles red thai curry chicken pizza steamed rice chicken tikka chicken wings and chicken pockets looking at the price of the drunch i feel a bit more items should have been on offer their chicken pizza and chicken tikka were simply delicious however they need to work upon their thai curry and the availability of other items in the layoutthe best part about the place was the drinks section loved the preparation of wet garden cocktail sangria and cranberry cooler special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks one can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the placeall in all the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes happy eating
hyper local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs despite that it has a reputed name and hypethe place is widely spread evenly with three sections two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop areathe first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar the two sections are contrasting with each other the bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drinkhyper local has introduced the trending drunch a sundowner party on sundays from 3pm to 7pmit includes unlimited food and drinks in rs 1200 _the food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters main course and dessertthe drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentationscoming to food the menu is inspired from the delhi region thus has the typical delhi street style starters like gol gappe papdi chaat matar kulche chole bhature and dahi vadethe main course has a subtle style including thai red curry noodles rice chicken pockets chicken tikkadessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yummdrinks were amazing here my personal favourite was pina colada fall alert and sangria wine from the menuhyper local is also streaming live ipl matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit ambiencerecommended
i tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 2+2 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well the waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we dont speak hindi of course we left immediately and dont think that will ever come back
i went there two times both for lunch first time food was very tasty and service was great but second time there was a little rush which detoriated the quality of food and service both a little bit but overall nice place and a must visit
situated at the top floor of sln terminus along with food court areaambience and decor is pleasingbuffet doesnt do justice to price paid in terms of variety and service we had to wait for bowls spoons and refill of chutney etcthey serve one veg soup 2 veg starter live pasta which was also not upto the mark 3 curry rice biryani and different bread option gulabjamun and ice cream in dessert
nice and friendly place food was tasty and delicious service was very slow not able to manage for a bigger crowd of 15 people overall a decent place for food
this place is within the sln mall in gachibowli we took the outdoor seating the ambience is fantastic had couple of bears with fries chilli paneer dahi kabab and spring rolls the chilli paneer was very tasty kabab a bit sweet for my taste buds i feel the good options can be increased overall good experience
u will not find many veg items here but the biryani quantity wise it will be adequate quantity for both people we ordered green veg gulati not so good and one veg biryani
the ambinece is greet for a weekends night party the outdoor siating the food is greet verry fraindly staf thanks roshan coming agen and agen
the ambience is great for a weekend night party the outdoor seating view is super staff is friendly and very interesting dishes to choose from the tacos are the best on the menu do try
ambience is good but not a lot of food options are there tried there mocktails which could have been better and the food was okayincrease the food and drinks options
best place to partypro1tastey food2 pizza especially chicken tikka pizza was best the crust and the toppings are great3 bira is available4 the bartenders bartending skill and dance is awesome5 overall experience was goodcons1 no dance floor2 the space itself is bit congested 3 we went for 1+1 buffet offers with gold but it was not there despite the offer being shown in zomato

this is a quite happening place with good food and perfect ambience with the added outer seatingmenu options are limited but the taste is very goodyou should have a prior reservation in case if you are too many peopleit has good music along with a teeny tiny dance floor
lovely place with decent ambience the food is really good one of the best service in the city in hyper local roshan was really amazing overall i have an awesome experience good team and l will visit again
undoubtedly the best place to have ice creams nowadays is cream stone near to dlf and many hostels polite staff and friendly always crowded
always love to swiggy this food nutella brownie and ferrero rocher is amazing well packaged and well sent no issues till date except i gain weight a bit fan
the staff was polite and friendly the quality has been upto the mark at creamstone from the beginningthe taste of the ice cream was also amazing and so was the ambience but it was a little crowded than expected but it was worth the visitkeep it up creamstone gachibowli
twisted mango mango famous within summer season this summer you had mango or not guys you should taste this mango flavor i am sure mango lover will like this
i had death by chocolate from here i cant find words to describe it it was so goodtaste 5 5amount 5 5 it will be hard to finish by only one personi already had three times by now and having morerecommended
just because of a silly reason your customer care executives are talking about rules and ruthlessly saying customer has to bear the costs for uber mistake
staff is very polite and helpfulservices provided is simply amazingdecor is comfortablethe menu contains variety of flavours and each one of them has unique taste to offerprices are pretty decentdo try their tiramisu chocolate hot choco fudge i wish if they served more quantity in the same price
had the best of icreams at #creamstone we went there around 2 in the morning they have different flavours to pic from we had alfanso fruit exotica and ferrero rocher exquisite desserts with unique taste i loved the alphanso they chopped these mangos over the yummy icecreamhighly recommended
we ordered alphonso ice cream we got it with only 23 pieces of mango this is not expected from cream stone as we r regular customer
willy wonka is my favourite it is so delicious and so chocolatey the taste is so good and the choco chips are so crunchy and the brownie is so good totally it is fab
this place is heaven for ice cream lovers used to visit this place everytime after having biryani in paradise best part abt them is they prepare orders on stone counter only so u see things live happening
its summer try to grab this delicious alphonso mango icecreami loved iti thoroughly enjoyed having this one this is to all the mango lovers out there
quality was bad they just scoop ice cream
i ordered death by chocolate ice cream and as expected the taste was awesome and the best part was the delivery packing it was so nice that ice cream did not melt a bit also overall a good experience
the ice cream is really good the ambiance is cute and the staff is courteous no complaints as such i like my ice cream to be a little subtle sweet but would highly recommend this to all the ice cream lovers
do i have to write something about this ofcourse all of us love it i especially love their alphonso mango really like their nutella brownie as well
i liked the way they present and the staff were all ladies who prepared the order ice cream was too good that i felt better than naturals at that time i ordered fresh fruits and nuts and it was amazing
rich taste exotic flavours its my favourite place for desserts and birthday cakeswould definitely recommend everyone to try their ice cream cakes
very good concept and unique flavours my personal favourite is fruit exotica and tiramisu would certainly again and again just to have these two flavourseagerly waiting for season special alphonso ice cream
ive had a number of ice creams here and all the time theyre different flavours but nothing can beat their forever amazing brownie break absolutely love it
when youre craving ice cream and a burst of fresh fruit and nutty flavours cream stone is my go to i always order the green apple ice cream with nuts but when i placed an online order that wasnt available so i picked the fruit and nut overload and it was heavenly the rich texture if the ice cream combined with the fresh nuts is a delight cream stone can never go wrongtaste 5 5service 5 5
had their nutella brownie ice cream in a cup great tasting it got delivered with proper packaging and dry ice great to the taste just wish they were priced bit lower will definitely try their other offerings
basically i hail from kolkatamy inlaw gave a treat at this plcjust fell in love with this plceagerly waiting for opening their outlet in kolkata
i have ordered nuts loaded ice cream and also dry fruit ice cream really both ice creams taste was worst they have added more anjeer rather than other dry fruitsreally i didnt feel like i am eating ice cream because of anjeer i never going to order ice cream from cream stone people who wants ice cream taste dont go for cream stone dry fruit nuts overloaded and afghan ice creamprice also not reasonable
its a awsm experiencei just love creamstones ice creamvery fast delivery nd never delayed me orderi wish it will remain sameice creams are so tasty and once someone order frm here am damn sure they never think to go to another icecream shop to eat icecream
my fav past time and this is mine nd my besties favourite place to chill out i do order any tine required and their delivery packaging is even quite good best part is it is opened till 1 am

good place to order ice cream#hyderabad #icecream #lovers #milksheaks #lovers #try #it #from #hrere where the cream stone gachibowli hyderabad
doesnt entertain ordered placed through food ordering apps had to wait for 45 mins before cancelling the order i even talked to the cashierafter assuring the order will be ready in sometime there was no update
i did not have a good experience here the service wasnt good the ice cream looked good but i didnt like the taste too many nuts the listing in the menu was a bit misleading and didnt have anything mentioned about nuts
great taste nice quality affordable prices effective varities plus zomato on time delivery i order here almost daily only problem with this place is caution you will get addicted for sure
if you are an icecream lover you might have already been here cream stone is one of the best places to get many variety flavoured icecreams at anytime
i am wondering if i had ordered thick shake or an ice cream thick shake will have better consistency than this most of my previous orders were in the same condition yet i gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand not any more spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste if you guys couldnt provide ice cream in proper way then please stop giving home delivery despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner i wonder if i can actually call this as an ice cream some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted not satisfied with your ice cream not worth spending a single rupee on this onei was trying to take a pic and then this happened i didnt keep pressure while holding you can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture i didnt had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out both quantity n quality was not good i understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate i place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes despite of the distance and presence of dry ice the ice cream melted completely
the quality is good but found hair in my order which is not good please be sure the food is good while delivering it hope it would be better next time
i used to crave for the place before i visit and now it seems the waiting was worthy in each bite i can feel the delicacy but we had full stomach when we ordered fruit overloaded and chocolava but i would suggest for one for two people
awesome ice cream shop had waffle nutcracker and lichi lake would recommend to all taste was good and quite budget friendly try out magic pops if you have not tried before
though busy but an awesome place to hang out grab some delicious combinations of chocolate nutty icecreams shakes waffles and you could probably have the best icecreams to satisfy your cravings
one of my favourite cream stone loved the taste with brownie chocovala i was completely satisfied with the chocovala i will suggest this to my friends they can also enjoy this same feeling
#masti time helped a lot refreshing memories #office time best choice for the ice cream shops nearby gachibowli do try death by chocolate
as we all know that cream stone is a good place for hangout and its quite famous for best ice creami love this place and i was in my office so we are thinking to order but again we decided to go there and have funso me and my friends was started our trip and it was a fun while reaching therewe reach there and have some stone ice cream it was a really good concept of making ice cream on stone and it was a perfect way to make because i have seen many place of making stone ice cream but it was totally different and perfect way we enjoyed our night at cream stone and it was really good time with my friend at cream stone
look at the quantity of icecream charging 175 and the product should be worth to it right and the brownie is not at all backed its completed rock chilled
i am a huge fan of cream stones death by chocolate ice cream ive never personally been there and i always got it deliveredthe packing is always so amazing its one box of chocolate cake with loaded chocolate sauce and another box that has a mix of vanilla and chocolate ice creamits a must try for all the chocolate lovers out there
cool place which will be available till 1pm in hyd beat icreams and very unique especially they have wide range of varieties in chocolate types and service is also quite good except their gm singing in the outlet p
the best shop worth to buy desserts i brought a caramel sutra its osssssomfrom packing delivering to food taste everything is finemy first order after reaching hyderabad
visited this place a while back their ice creams are totally worth it id suggest try their listed sundaes rather than make a custom one the prelisted choices are just so much better the only issue is their seating space is a little less so we took our ice creams to go but would recommend it just for the taste
i had dry fruit overload ice cream from this outlet it was the most amazing experience i had on that day if i have to order an ice cream again i will surely choose cream stone again damn it was so amazing i am out of words right now
interior is good but small one and quality of ice cream also good but some of the items like chocolate u cant eat alone bcz of it sweetness
i am not happy the way it is managed no proper response from the workers my order was not yet prepared and these people are not ready to replace my 1 order out of 10+ items which i have orders these people are not working for customer satisfaction they are working for only money not at all happy this time
the more you have the more you crave one of the best icecream concepts ever the way they serve icecream blended in the taste itself is just awesome
i had gone to this place and ordered nutty overload icecream and chocolate icecream with waffles the nutty overload icecream was really good
ordered nuts overloaded tasted like nothing you could have ever tasted with every bite of the icecream you get loads of nut in your mouthcream stone has variety of self made ice creams which will make you feel special ye maine kuch bhi likh diya couldnt think of what to write
cream stone is already aware brand chain as we all know and their quality and making of icecream and shakes are super and every one should try once its costly but the quality also high
i have ordered willy wonka for home delivery it became over frozen by the time i received the same i did a complain and very next day cream stone sent another ice cream for free keep up ur good service
cream stone is just an amazing place to have some dessert they have almost all the flavors that you can ask for in icecreams they have shakes waffles ice creams sundaes and what notthe ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoplesi tried the red velvet and willy wonka icecreams they are served on a cone which is also very crispywilly wonka is made from chocolate brownies and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one one ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordinglymust try if you have a sweet tooth
ordered fruit exotica and fruit and nuts icecream on two different days once from swiggy and once from zomato the icecreams were both melted and lacked the flavour and quality that is usually offered by cream stone highy disappointed i was a fan of cream stone icecreams but i wont recommend this to anyone ever again not worth spending money on
a must try for all the ice cream lover loved thier way of delivering the ice cream they put ice in the packet which they deliver ice cream so it can remain frozen awesome concept loved it you could try all menu but personal favourite is willy wonka do give it a try guys
ordered fruit exotica and i dont know what the hell is this ice cream but sure its not what i ordered not the experience what i wanted but that was indeed a surprise
we ordered fruit exotica it was worth the money had many fruits overloaded into it had many seasonal fruits along with other fruits can try this anytime
one of my weekend chill out placemy favourite ice creams arenuts overloaded arabian nights dry fruit delight ferrero rocher fruit exotica
one busy place especially in the eveningscream stone has created a special place for itself since beginning all the ice creams are tasty and the mix inswide range of ice creams cream blends home made waffle bowls and cones makes it uniquemy personal fav are alphonso mango icecream death by chocolate and brownie breakone good stop for ice cream lovers
taste was pathetici didnt like it roadside ice cream would be better than this
very good on time delivery
it was great but the standards have lowered my choco lava was like stone and ice cream was like cream anusha has done the worst jobi now dont prefer this placethere are much better places where people at least listen when you say how your ice cream is looking
best place for ice cream in the area the ambience is also nice the nutty concepts range of ice cream is a must try the rates are higher but the quality is good
best ever ice cream i have ever had for the last few years and i have a lot of people who feel like me ijust love you so much for the great ice cream you have made for me
i loved the taste of qvality of ice cream and i love the response of the restaurant and its delecious mostily i love the afghan nuts ice cream
wonderful place for ice creams my favorite would recommend this place to my friends and family great ambience great taste and consistency of the ice creams is very good
quantity was less
ice cream got melted even before reaching memy place is 5 min from creamstone
nice place staffs are friendly and create great icecream experiencelocation is perfect just in the heart of gachibowli one of the favourite hangout places for people
ordered nuts overloaded ice creamfantastic taste
delivery was before time 5 star for delivery person
cream stone is the best hangout place when it comes to latenight drives only issue is the place can become a bit crowded and order takes a bit extra time to come
its a creamstone what can i say goodnicecream is my weakness but this branch has just become super busy can you see how many zomato guys have lined up for the order
well i love love love all the icecreams here having said that i have my favourites three to be precise death by chocolate chocolate overdose and karamel sutra when i am on a diet i get their diet fruit concept icecream i am that mad about their icecreams this is one of those places where i gawk on my food and forget to click pictures
its too crowded with delivery executives all the time dont find place to sit mostly itd be better if they provide some way out preferable to online order than physical visit
cream stone is always best but even when the cake that we require is completed they are still showing the cake on online delivery it can be changed so that customers dont face any trouble
whenever i have a craving for ice creams cream stone is the solution i am a coffee lover so the first thing that i tried here is coffee craze the taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts the next thing that i tried here is the chocolate overdose its a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie the icecreams are extremely rich and intense overall i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours
i could not finish ice cream at all not at all goodnever like the place as specially sitafal taste is very very bad very crowdy place but taste is not at all good
goo blend of ice cream good flavours as well they have many varieties in fruit and chocolate flavors try ice cram but big no for waffles they are very hard
poor service have ordered ice cream and it took 1 hour to reach meby the time when it reached its not like ice cream its like milk shake completely melted they didnt add solid ice inside the package at all too pathetic online delivery service by creamstone gachibowli branch never expected this from them because am a big fan of creamstoneit disappointed me badly by its poor service
cream stone is always a best place if you are found of variety of icecreams been here for many occasions and when we thought of visiting a place in the late night taste is very good and prices are moderate and variety of the items are so good i would definatly recommend all to visit here
ordered nutella brownie and got brownie and vanilla ice cream its a shame that they write the name of the ice cream correct take the money correct but fail to make the ice cream correct not expected from cream stone your customers are not fools dont insult them by assuming that they are less intelligent
i love treating myself to cream stone every once in a while its the perfect treat ive tried almost all their flavors and i love every single one my favorite would be willy wonka i love chocolate im not fond of their waffles though but the ice creams are to die for definitely visit cream stone
good timing
i have heard a lot about this ice cream parlour from my friends of hyderabad and chennai i didnt miss to visit this place when i was in hyderabad i ordered one ferrero rocher it was like heaven the place is very small for indoor seating i think the management should increase their indoor seating arrangement due to their large crowdif u r a icecreamlover this place will be the perfect bliss for you
a perfect dessert for you and a must have surprise gift for your partner try the chocolate over dose and enjoy the pure bliss of chocolate in your mouth can reduce the sugar content a bit
its a ever busy place that reeks of laughter sugar in the air the cream stone brand is ever known but what sets apart gachibowli from others is its courteous staff ambient seating area its a go to place for isb iiit hcu students
totally recommended for crazy ice snowpplambience 2 5taste 5 5pocket friendly 3 5this place is not at all for dine in because of crowdthere is flavour for every one
good
excellent service
super delevery
delivery behaviour good
i have ordered several times from cream stoneone of the finest place for ice creams quality and taste of ice creams are top notch you will fall in love with this ice creams
please look at the below image this is how i got my order when i order from zomato i had a confusion to eat it or gulp it however i gave 2 for the browny
not ggod
they didnt packed the ice cream nicely ie didnt keep any dry ice because of that it got melted and spreads in the pckage a bit disappointed other than that taste is good
ice cream was melted before it reached me and i didnt see dry ice pieces in it either service was too bad
ice cream was good but its totally got melt as delivery boy took a lot of time to reach he mentioned it as delivered as soon as he picked order he took nearly 45 minutes to come
1half of ice cream spilled inside the package only2i ordered caremel sutrabut i got brownie ice cream3and i cream is in liquid state like a milkshakei did not expect this from cream stone at alli have pic of them with me
the food is economically reasonable the north indian dishes including chole kulche chole bhature and paneer butter masala are comparatively better than the chaats
oh ho this place serves amazing parathas and their combos are worth it you experience it to appreciate it lot of crowd at meal times so u might have to wait 1520 min for your parantha to be made but worth the waitthey have a small seating area inside too
today i was very hungry as i had to skip my breakfast due to the workload moreover i didnt want to spend more than a hundred bucks on the brunch this was the only restaurant on my mind you can order a paratha soaked in butter with raita chutney and onions it is heavenly all for less than 100
ordered vada pav and pav bhaji they had a variety of chats both the dishes were too delicious a good snacks joint in hyderabad their dahi papri should top your list
order rajma in 200 rupees taste is not that good and quantity is too less as per chargestoo too much spicy was not able to eat it without waterif you cant cook properly better dont sell it
their gol gappa is a must try it is different from what we get in hyderabad chole bhature was also good ignore the attitude of the staff especially the one at the counter
aloo onion paratha was awesome delicacy to have sardarji tussi great ho mouth watering would love of you provide some more at cheaper price lassi is awesome as well thank you paji
been there for couple of times hoping that they will improve in terms of quality and service but honestly if you really want to eat some dumplings mix with 2or 3 pices of potatoes or paneer or whatever then go there and i bet you you will curse yourself later the funniest thing is that they dont even know how to make a proper paratha or kulcha they are just making fool to everyone on the name of north indian food instead search for another joints in madhapur or gachibowli like parathas and more or just paratha there you will get the real authentic food
dropped down my expectations ordered aloo tikki which was worst and palak chat which ended up delivering dhahi chat that tasted sweet i regret ordering
i ordered dahi bhalla papdi chaat and this is how they packed they should pack it in a plastic box the dahi was spilled over the polythene and hardly 20 of the dahi was left in the container i paid money for nothing they should give my money back for it
i have been visiting ordering from this place for over 2 years now chaats here used to be amazing but the quality these days has gone down
i love the gol gappe here at hyderabad the gol gappe are different they add dal in it where as i am used to masala aloo filling and they provide it best in gachibowli
if you are craving for a chaat you must visit this place i tried karara palak chaat dahi poori and paani poori its not as good as we have it in north but definitely a must try
i ordered aloo methi paratha and im it was awesome just feel lik im eating ghar ka khana its yummypreviously also i have ordered from this restaurant and the food is so good i think people should go there and have food its really good
the food is delicious from this place very meticulous packaging ive tried pav bhaji chole bhature and almost all the snacks the place has to offer reasonable prices and good food quality id definitely recommend this place to try for various chaats and snacks
i had food from this place many times i was glad when i found north indian chat in hyderabad its not that good as we can have in north but still a good chat place as compared to others whatever i know quanity5 5quality 4 5packaging 5 5delivery 5 5
lods of lods of lods of foodare you veg lover then it will be like paradise for you they server many varities of kulcha paratha vada pav sand wich chats loved aloo kulcha and dal makhani like hell paratha and vada pav are yummy we have mixed veg paratha and the taste was good with many veggies in it vada pav was considerable nothing can beat mumbais vada pav had lemon juice but didnt like that we have opted for this as there is no lassi point in time over all good food with good price
good delivery
have been eating in sardarjis from a long time but now i feel they have lost the taste in their food nothing is good not even chat will have to look out for another option in hyderabad for good chat
amazing chaat and street food just like back in north the taste and hygiene is awesome which is why this place is in my list when it comes to street food their chats are delicious id ordered pav bhaji sev puri and vada pav all was yummy will recommend this place to anyone who is fond of north indian food
sardaarjis chaats more serves really good punjabi food if you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food this place is a really good option in and around gachibowli as the name suggests they have amazing chaatsi have tried parathas from a lot of places in gachibowli and found the perfect places for parathas but this place not only has tasty parathas but the price is also very reasonable the only problem is the packaging its not horrible you can work with it but comapared to a lot of other places it is not that greataloo paratha combo had two big parathas pickel raita and onions it was delivered hot and fresh papadi with dahi was delicious the curd was smooth and creamy not at all sour and had a tangy sauce added in it the papadis were very crispy and crunchy it was topped with green chutneythe quantity of the chaat isnt a lot so if youre really hungry maybe order two of these or order something else with itill definitely try their other chaat options soonsince i never visited this place cant talk much about the hygiene of this place but overall the experience was good
in plain simple words overhyped very greasy and oily and bland taste order chole bhatire mix veg kulcha daal makhani and aloo tikki everything was very poor in taste better to put some effort and visit bikanerwala in jubilee hills
not the place if you belong to northern india no doubt the hygiene is well maintained but food is not as delicious as i expected it to be service is quick though also they dishes are quite overpriced
world class tasty
maybe all these 4 and 5 star reviews are paid ones ordered aloo paratha first of all quality of the food is bad bad odour from raita and then instead of sending pickle they sent something where i can only see mirchis but no pickle
the chaat that this restaurant offers is amazing and never ate such delicious sevpuri ever in hyderabad amazing taste satisfying quantity chaat lovers must try
went two three times after that decided to give the rating 5 what ever the item i consumed are very tasty like paneerbutter masala aloo paratha paneer kulhca samosa ragada chole batura not enough place packed with people still delivering the orders in time is good overall you can visit this place
its simply awesome one of the best places in gachibowli to have proper delicious authentic north indian chat items the real chat palace i dont think anyone would get disappointed with the food here nice place to go in the evenings and have something tasty like kachori pav baji dahipuri vada pav etc etc i would highly recommend everyone to taste food here
it was too good we ordered bhelpuri dahi papri and aloo tikki with chutney i must admit three of them were equally good the dahi papri was sweet n tangy bhelpuri was well balanced with spices and lot of shev and finally aloo tikki with dhaniya chutyney was tangy and spicy in a balanced way with well balanced spices and awesome taste this place stole my heartatoneplaceonlinecom
we tried aloo tikki with dahi although it was not bad but it was not like authentic delhi side aloo tikkii will definitely try other dishes here
yesterday i ordered chole bhature and tawa butter pav bhaji chole were lip smacking its a must try for all pav bhaji was a bit of disappointment the quantity of bhaji was less and taste was just average thats why i deducted 1 star but chole definitely deserves the rest 4 stars
food had no flavour doesnt have any flavour of authentic punjabi food food is too plainwould not recommend this even as last resort try to
the food is great but they can improve on the ambience especially liked the golgappe and chaat though ordering food online was not a great experience once i recieved incomplete order while other time packaging of chaat wasnt great
i had tried the paneer kulcha combo and aloo tikki it was delicious and their chole is the best price is very reasonable and delivery is also good
ordered paav bhaji chole bhature and papdi chatbut they forgot to deliver the chati was a bit disappointed by thatbut the taste was good
i ordered paneer butter masala paneer quality is best but gravy is not tasty
missing cutlery
i ordered paneer butter masala with one butter naan and lachha paratha and my alltime favorite punjabi chole bhaturechole bhature was yummy paneer butter masala was not that great in comparison of chole bhature
this restaurant is famous for quick bites and street food it is located in indra nagar gachibowli which is the most accessible place for techies in hyderabad this place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintainedwe get all kinds of street food like chaat pav bhaji paratha chole bhature rajma chawal etc we had chole bhature and this was the best that i had in the recent times if you want you can get extra chole curry and the butter milk and lassi here has the punjabi essence in it you will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with butter milk lassiif youre in search of proper north indian snacks or street food do visit and try food from this restaurant the cost in this restaurant is very affordable for the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable
delivery by zomato by quick they have removed sandwiches from their menu some of the food items are priced high overall good experiencechole bhatoore 5 5 chole bhatoore were amazing do eat those bhatoore at the outlet itself
sardarjis gives you a feel of north indian chat and chole bhatoore outlets they have that similar arrangement outside where everyone have to stand and enjoy their chat pav bhaji chole bhatoore on high tablesi recently visited sardarjis and tried lot of items of itgol gappe 35 5 gol gappes were good but the paani can be made more tangythey only have one varieties of paani and of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in italoo tikki 4 5 aloo tikki was very good red and green chutneys were perfectsamosa 4 5 chole bhatoore 5 5 chole bhatoore were amazingdo eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at homecholes are also very tastylooking forward to try more of their itemstheir naan size was huge and other items looked very temptingmust visit place if you want to enjoy some tasty chat chole bhatoore and that too at a very affordable price
taste not good as expected ordered a dahi papdi chaat but not worthy taste not good as expected ordered a dahi papdi chaat but not worthy
chat section is awfulvery badordered aloo tikki chatdahi tikki chatand papdi chatgot messy papdi and spoild foodtaste was very badshittyit was like cheatinga customer who paid u
food here is decent for the price paid paneer paratha was awesome and huge could easily fulfill even when one is very hungry tried others like paneer butter masala didnt like it that much
no cutlery no seal on the box poor packing
a very good chaat and snacks stop reminds me of north indian street chaats taste and am a regular customer here now especially of papadi chaat worth a try and you will love it
i have been here many times i like the food but never order food online youll get very cold food inspite of instructions to name a few samosas veg biryani etc youll definitely regret
sardarjis chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi the sandwiches especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome the dahi bhalla dahi papdis are good too however off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the foodanother complaint i had with them are their parathas they are bad polar opposite to their chaat dishes i would never recommend anyone ordering parathas from this place and i tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked this is the reason i have rated them as 3 out 5
better to take away or ask for delivery cost is fine but the taste is the specialty north indians can find their taste and dishes being rediscovered here
the perfect north food with perfect punjabi taste from the chaat to bhature all the items are good if you are looking for northpunjabi dish order youll love it
testless foodnan are almost burntdont like the food at allthe paneer butter masala tests like sumberthey have send tadka in place of dal makhnitotally wastage of money
awesome food i tried chat and samosa and it is one of the best in hyderabad must try and zomato provide the facility to order online which adds to your likings
i received wrong orderi tried to contact with restaurant but they didnt received the callthis is the worst experience ever i ordered online
excellent taste
i went to the himagiri hospital and when i came out of there i really felt hungry and so my sister suggested that we should go to this place as this place serves excellent punjabi food i ordered chole bature and lassi trust me the type of lassi which i had over there i had exactly that kind only in punjab and nowhere else the chole bature too was deliciousbut i didnt like the ambiance just try to work on that otherwise everything is upto the markambiance25 5food5 5service35 5
if you are from north and you miss its chat then this place is a must visit for all chat lovers they have tastiest samosa chat and bhel puri and their pani puri is so so amazing
we ordered samsa chola kulcha chola and sandwichs the taste quality is too much low i did not eat this type of quality food from different restaurantworst taste and worst quality i ever had
this the the beat place to have real #punjabi food the taste and aroma of delicious food is juat mouth watering you will not regret any single time to eat here
nice taste of north indian chaat rahi bhalle and chole bhature chole bhature is one of the favourite for us most of the time ordered from here specially for that
roti nd nan both u gave me without butter nd i ordered with butternd both are burnt even paneer curry quantity was too less manno1 can eat a single chapathi with thatnd panner pieces were in burnt condition
they will accept your order even if they dont have the items after 40 mins they say they dont have it and doesnt cancel it and delivery boy will also mark your order as delivered in short words go for dine in or choose different good apps to order
too bad service does not accept the order multiple times does not receive calls too and the best part they cancel the orders after money gets deducted very bad experience i mean worst experience
really good with the taste and the quality pocket friendly and worth giving a try dal makhani with rice is what i would recommend to try
i have been to this place after six months i have tried chaat and aloo naan with daal makhni but all tasted averagethere is some serious issue with the person sitting at cash counter he was very unprofessional with customers
packing is not good
no spoon no tissues
located in indira nagar this outlet serves chats along with limited tandoor and punjabi style main course dishes ordered paneer butter masala half along with rumali roti and butter naan prices were reasonable and pocket friendly less than 200 bucks aipaneer butter masala was extra tangy unlike traditional restaurant style dishes paneer quantity was very less 4 small pieces served in a cup of smooth textured gravy tandoori items tasted good ordered earthen pot cooled milk in the end with chat masala added 30 bucks per glass
tasteless dal makhani eating kulcha with it made it tasteless too
excellent delivery
hyderabad and good north indian food was wondering where will i find such good north indian food until i landed to this placetaste ordered chats and dal makhani alu kulcha combo must say such tasty punjabi food made me very happyservice good servicethe counter is busy on weekends totally if you crave for punjabi food this is a must visit place
the best vada pav i had in gachibowli chaats are just awesome you will love alu kulcha with dal makhani although they should increase the quantity of dal makhani but overall its a great place to eat
ordered via zomato delivery great taste and packaging however portions can be increased a little though also dude no onion or green chutney along
it was the second time i ordered something from here and both the times food was delicious first time i ordered for an alloo paratha it was huge in size and wasnt able to eat full and this time ordered aloo cheese sandwich it was yummy loved it will definitely try some other things from here
this is something one would definitely like they serve n number of variety in north indian food must try once they will never disappoint you l bet
one of the better places to go for north indian style paranthas chat is also good not that great though if you want north indian style have been here quite a number of times and always find it crowded has never disappointed
had samosa pani puri kulcha combo herebest food hygiene wise a bit low food was far better to ignore all other lowshighly recommend
yesterday there was leakage of water pipe possibly drainage pipe at restaurant instead of repairing that they are shamelessly kept counter open customer had to stand in line while water is leaking beside and at the same time eat beside that water leaking pipeline i would suggest first repair pipe line and then open restaurant serving in this condition to customers shows no value of customers
ordered bhel puri from this place and i found an ant in while i was eating these guys are unhygienic and dont take necessary precautions to ensure that they protect the food they prepare from all the insects around the area be careful
if you dont want to deliver the food then dont accept the orders in the first place and the cancellation call from zomato comes when you expect your food be careful while accepting the orders or at least dont make the hungry people wait even to know about the cancellations giving 1 star bcoz cant rate below that
punjabi food gets youwell go there soon then their chole bhature and club grilled sandwiches are something which are really amazing even the best joints cant beattheres no ambiance or proper sitting but its worth it
worst daal makhani i have ever tasted in my life kinda weird taste it wasminus rating is not there otherwise i would definitely have punched that
the delivery guy didnt return the change he said he ll be getting change in 5 mins and he disappeared
this was very first time in south that i heard alot about northern delicacy chole bhature but i would say i am disappointed with the taste as it is nowhere near to what it should be and prices are also very high
delivery on time
if there was an option of putting up 0 stars i wouldnt have hesitated look at the kind of food they offer i had ordered this aloo kulcha combo from this restaurant a burnt kulcha and not even a bowlful of dal was served the combo mentioned pickle as well but that wasnt sent either despite complaining them with requisite proofs no action was taken terrible
i order a veg biryani it was cold when it reached me the taste was just bland and they had 1 4th of the biryani filled with half cooked beans even the cauliflower was not cooked properly they should just remove the biryani from their menu forever
had the worst experience ever having ordered paneer butter masala and getting mix veg paranthas was not at all expected so guys be prepared if you get a totally different dish than what you order online
again left the salad in the order
ordered samosa aloo tikki with chutney papdi dahi bhalla sev batata purisamosa with chutney was good liked itpapdi dahi bhalla was gooddidnt like the taste of sev batata puri did not like aloo tikki it was not freshly made felt like the potato was spoiltchole bhatoore was good and pav bhaji was okdidnt like the taste of bhel puri
ordered sev batata puri mumbai vada pav mumbai samosa pav samosa cheese grilled sandwich and veg club grilled sandwichtaste was goodnot spicy as preferredonly disappointed with the packaging
wahh ji waah dilli ki yaad dila diya apne tohafter staying in delhi for 3 years i was looking for a chatwala in hyderabad here i found the chatwala now the taste can be improved but something is better than nothing
if you crave for some mumbai style chaat then this modest place is for you absoultely pocket and taste bud friendly i would definitely recommend this for a casual snack time yet to try the main course here
very impressive delivery amazing work
chole was too oily
great place to have good chat very well made dahi papdi and aalu tikki especially because their dahi tastes very fresh and feels like home made only order one full paratha for yourself if youre extremely hungry though the filling is great but it is very heavy
heard a lot about this small food joint and the north indian stuff they make should say im disappointed looks like the quality is not the same as before even the price is a bit high compared to other places with similar taste
got the chole bhature for 66 only through fav50 was craving for some good old punjabi flavour and this was perfect
have only one packet of curry instead of 2
great good
they have reduced the quantity a lot
#foodengineeringg#ramadanspecial#reviewmodebbbq nation has come up with all new dawat e ramadan where theyve bought in few of the best street foods of ramadan which really makes one visit and satisfying their foodie soulsi was pretty excited to try out their ramadan special menu and the moment i enter i see a big raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot mutton chops searing on ghee that view enticed me and i just walked toward it to see that beauty happening i couldnt wait to try that super appetising chops and delicious raanbesides they also got chicken shawarma and mutton haleem which is another different delicacy storylinei had to take a big bowl of haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and final touch with two spoons of ghee yes thats my style i walked to see few more exciting dishes and i found the legendary badami gosht yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides murgh mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingerscannot miss thier gosht biryani one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well perfectly tender meat and soft and fragrant basmati with a touch of gheeonly because of the taste and being foodie i had two rounds of everything and was fullbut theres always a another stomach for kulfipanpistamalai voila
this is one of my favourite restaurant with grill concept ambience was really fascinating food quality was too good my favourite recipe is grill pineapple it is delicious
have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013 have been to the restaurant in different cities and have noticed some significant differences across all locationsthis gachibowli bbq nation has some items missing from its live counter but have curd rice which wasnt available in any other location i have been tothe staff is extremely courteous we were served by rajib who was really warm quick in his servicethe overall quality of the food was satisfying just like most of the other outlets ive been to
as usual its fab place to have grill in a buffet non veg is awesome here chicken mutton prawns fish are served on the grill some days you also get crab curry now they opened tawa starters as wellnice place to go for team lunch dinner
food quality is good but not so many items like crabs octopus kofta are available particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of bn or abs so it was really disappointingalso service was a bit slow we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between that really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good i think the number of waiters are lessac facility was good very coldbut i dont recommend this place
this is an amazing place for veg as well as non veg starters there are so many varieties in it as you will be already full you dont generally go for main course and also its very average i really love their service suppose you dont like item they will replace it by customising according to your requirement
service was excellent biriyani and service excellent very nice food very good staff and servise drinks was excellentbbq chiken very test and fish pine apple very test service and food quality is excellent
was wifes birthday and our anniversary as well naresh and bipul made it point to make it extra special the hospitality and the culture of the employees keeps taking me back there forever
this place always exceeds expectations friendly staff customised orders and finger licking good food and of course you need a second stomach for the desserts
its barbi bossno commentsits was sudden plan from gang to visit this place fortunately that day was 10 years celebrations day of bnwe got some discount on bill also we all from coastal area basically and sea food loversbelieve me or not i loved and felt happy wit prawns hereyummy and yummyit might sillywe did justice to my money may more alsothat was a weekday and i want to try this place on some weekend
had to wait a bit to get a table thats a good thing great food and best service such a great staff sudeep roy naresh ur a star i have seen him doing everything keep up the good work guys
i am a big fan of bbq nation since a decade now this however was my most dissatisfying experience to date after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the pastthe only thing they handled well from the word go was the seating i booked a table for 14 from zomato it was ready for us when we arrivedeverything else seemed to be falling apart their team was struggling to deliverthe starters took forever to be served most of them tasted similar though were called different things refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things the mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this some were duly replacedthe chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes when we held our ground he went back to personally create some dishes his version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by theni would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the tablehope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together
had a worst experience today at barbq nation gachhibowli hyderabadtaste is not as good as remaining branches non veg items seem to be frozen few days back then coocked feels like a was while eating
this is the worst barbeque i have ever seen in my life barbeque for name sake no barbeque item like paneer fish was baked properly waste of money
we went to this place as a part of corporate outing it was my first time to barbeque nation i must admit that i was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction the starters alone were enough to fill up my belly when it came to having the main course the options were not many but it suffficed i would say the waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies
barbeque is mostly my favorite but if i compare barbeque nation with abs sahibs barbeque obviously i have to give one point less to this onefood is good but limited itemsbut if you have kid go there my son and my friends kids enjoyed a lot there they were given car and balloon by staff and lots of fruits and french friesthey enjoyed to the core ambience is gud service excellentfood 3 5ambience 4 5service 5 5
this place was really amazing as usual the staff is very polite appreciate their work in maintaining professionalism loved being serviced by saif ali khan and staff
been to the place recently the service was on a slower side strangely but the food items on the grills taking a little longer to arrived food good as usual
friday afternoon we planned team lunch veg nonveg in gachibowli barbecue nation we were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food variety served was average and wasnt upto standard wrt taste varietyin short it wasnt value for money i think it would be better to choose absolute barbecue over barbecue nation as customer you get value for money seems like now barbecue nation is just riding on its legacy
inside atmosphere is goodand serving and way of treating everything i loved itand very reasonable price for partieswe can enjoy with friends
a wellknown place to have buffetstaff 5 5 starters 4 5 dessert 5 5 try chocolate kulfi and paan kulfimojito 3 5 main course 35 5 overall experience 4 5
located in the heart of financial district it is very convenient place to visit on a weekday with colleagues their service was simply superb they tried to understand the requirement of the customers on each and every table and customized the spice level etc based on the request had good number of options in veg as well over all food was very good service was exceptional
kirak bole tho kirak hyderabadi language just loved it had a nice time enjoyed the food mainly pan kulfi loved iiiittttttttttttttttttttttttttt
the staffs at bbq gachibowli are very good from start to end they took care which dish is good any modifications neededfood was very tasty starter+main course you can try fish finger chefs special made on request
friendly servicethe restaurant ambience is goodthe food tastes goodand they need to increase the dessertsand jst increase the itemsawesome finally
been many times here and the place is not crouded during dinner time the best time to visit this place is during dinner time only as lunch time too much crouded with office guys specially mon to fri coming to food prawns and fish starters are too too good other kebabs also too good staff is too good in service and they treat us like kings and queens i strongly recommend gachibowli branch as less crowded during dinner and weekens
the taste of increase when its bbq its taste doubled when is comes to barbeque nation service is more jet spedfood was excellentneed little improvement in ambiance
waiters butter customers more than the kebabs jokes apart the service is too good and they do have a decent range of items eventhough they lack in terms of number of items but its compensated with the quality level the place feels a bit cramped up bt got a good vibe to it definitely would visit again
awesome place awesome food lovely staff azaad hussain was tremendous at his work one of the most polite guy i ever see in any restaurant
this place is good when you come empty stomach just kidding barbeque nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts has a lag in my order when i had been there last time but i guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine a very good place with very welcoming staff
went yesterday to bbq wonderful service special thanks to roy who took care of ushe kept checking if everything was fine or need to customize anything food was yummy became a big fan of bbq good going guys
early christmas celebrations we were dressed up and wanted fine dine we were told that barbeque nation is always booked we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 930from the greeting to serving and the host was so nicei must give them 5 stars for excellent customer servicethe starters were amazingi love prawns but its kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned but their prawns are the best grilled prawns i ever tasted they could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine the starters were so yumm that we didnt want to try the main course my personal favs were grilled prawns and rosemary chickenmmm mmm mmmmm yummy thank you so much for your excellent service and great foodhope to visit you guys soon
who doesnt like bbq and having it from bbq nations is a good experience chicken tikka nadi fish are really tasty as part of new year celebration there were some new dishes which was passable expected better in desserts
we have been having a grand time whenever we visit barbeque nation gachiwoli be it the food the ambience and the hospitality of the staffs this place is a must visit the staffs here treat you as a part of family and serve you till you get the utmost satisfaction on the taste and quantity of the foodi would specially like to mention about mr naresh from bbq nation gachiwoli the way he treats and welcomes you will make you visit this place all over again and again he takes care of you from giving you the best seats available to the best of the food you can have i give him and this place 5 bright stars
food 45ambiance good enoughservice the staff were all very polite but a bit slowthe taste of food was very good they had chicken tandoori mutton kebab veg kebab american corn creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff on the grill they served one variety each of chicken basa fish prawn mushroom paneer pineapple the main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it the dessert options were sorted and tasty they had 2 ice cream flavours gulab jamun kheer brownie milk cakes pastries and tarts 2 kulfi over all the experience was very goodwould want to visit again
it used to be one of my favourite places and the destination for all family celebrations however over the time i feel it has lost that touch there is no more aawww feeling when u eat at this place they dont compromise on the quality of food but i was disappointed with the taste we tried at both forum mall and gachibowli branches and it felt the same
been here with friends on a weekday for dinner and this place never fails to meet expectationsbe it any outlet the food is greatthe staff was friendly only one negative with this outlet is spaceit is extremely congestedthe tables are too closely placedhardly any proper aisle space for guests to walk
great staff always ready to serve with smile celebrated our anniversary over there got exceptional service by ravi kumud and chef always take care of our spice level love to visit again and again
very much satisfied with the food and service they had customised kulfi with different types of toppings and its really good the nonveg starters are served with normal spice levels and are tasty if you like spicy food ask for tandoori chicken with extra spices you will love it
had been there twice everytime had a wonderfyl experience good ambience and very friendly staffs the chef himself turn to us asking for any special items to be ordered great service
foodi had the non veg buffeti loved the starters and the dessertsi personally like their kulfies the mosteverything elsei have been to this branch twice service is really goodi had a great experience its the best barbeque restaurant i have been towill i go again definitely
we were here to give our treat to a group of friends what started out with cold barbeque bad grills turned out to worst the grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant as soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters werent coming quickly we dint know what we were calling for the waiters visited our table every 23 mins to enquire if everything is alright now i am not exaggerating when i say that they came to me at least 2025 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good i did not dare to say that they werent still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming they almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal finally i was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till i did that feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture the food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good barbeque nation please dont pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz its extremely irritating being answerable every minute btw this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad
the best restaurant we have been to till dateawesome food and great service the hospitality shown at the restaurant each and every time that we have visited is at the peaks compared to other restaurants we treat this restaurant as a family restaurant and make sure we visit this once a month never disappointed us in any aspectnot even once
we went to barbeque nations for thanks giving special day team lunchitems are good but service is very slow we waited for long time for food items after ordereddeserts and starters are nice
good place for team lunch but has pathetic veg starters option potato and mashroom but they tell will smile that this is all for today i am writing this review whole i am in the restraint itselfimprove barbequeevery customer is important
for ravi he is friendly politely answering to questions good in taste yeah its very good everything is fine and the kulfi you dont believe me
extremely courteous staff great servicespecial mention to kumud barman for his exemplary servicekeep up the good work guys good job
nice place very good food but main course should be be improved because starters 4 dessert 4 and main course 35 because food in main course was not upto mark need some taste build up
5 star standard specially mentioning rm mr bivison and staff mr gopal we were welcomed served and treated with high standard quality also the chef basudev make sure that our prefrance is fulfilledthank you bivison and for taking care

have visited this place on 2nd october with my family to celebrate my sisters birthday all the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch place is not that huge but very well maintained hospitality is top notch by their staffcoming to food starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table chicken prawns mushroom paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely it was really amazing in taste potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow there was no dish which didnt disappointmain course this is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations all the dishes were really good in taste usually i skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here i have tried and it was really good egg curry chicken mutton rogan all were good biryani was also good noodles with sauce were delicious enough it wasnt their just to keep up the numbersdessert my favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth pastries please cake kheer brownie all were good kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the topoverall we had a ball at this place from starter to main course and dessert all were really good they didnt give us any point where anything can be deducted service was top notch as usual and value for money this outlet is one the best on in hyderabad hands down
we are very satisfied with the food and the service was excellent we want our customers to be fully satisfied said the chef and he meant it
we went to this place on wednesday for dinner it was difficult to find a table and had to wait for 30 minutes the ambience of the place is average and its a small place however the starters were really good crispy corn panner tikka mushroom and fruit bbq coming to the main course it was average but the desserts were really good especially gulab jamun rabadi and kulfi
really these barbeque nations outlet is so friendlyi never seen beforewe went there last night total number were 40+lots of kids were in my gangthey are playing a lotthey are means staffs of barbeque nation always looking smilenow foods are just too goodkuch kehene ki baat i nehi hain
to start with the complimentary drinks blue mojito pacific blue fresh lime soda were refreshing the nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken prawns or fish head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day the veg starters mushroom is a immediate no cripsy corn was not salted properly paneer came as a saviour maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer coming to desserts its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled browine was too dry cakes were not tasty apple pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup phirni an absolute no kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section i can only rate it 3 for food 5 for service 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter
we had a fantastic time and loved the service and food both the serving personnel made extra sure of comfort for the kids kudos to azaad and team
i almost forgot to write the review as i got too busy until i found these pictures in my gallery i was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month what a bad day it was when you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food first of all the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen i was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances i politely asked to replace the drink that was served but things got too much for me when i found a hair in the crispy corn when i put this into light to the serving staff they just tried to take away the plate and all i got to listen was they will replace it thats what drove me mad when i demanded to see the manager he apologized and asked for the plate replacement but i was done with the food now no more nonsense at the end the manager showed up with a specially made chocovanilla dessert in pic not just the hygiene but the service was bad too the team was all the time waiting for them to get the food the overall experience was bad something not expected from a bbq nation
this place goes and keeps up with the name amazing starters the chicken kebabs are wonderful the crispy corn and the cajun spice potatoes are super duper awesome after the rounds of starters there wasnt any space for the main course so directly went for desserts their in house kulfis are the speciality here paan kulfi tastes the best gulab jamuns with icecream make the perfect combo
awesome food and awesome servicespecially by mr gopal who was awesome with his services keep it up and thumbs up for barbeque nation gachibowlimy birthday went awesome
food quality has degraded than beforeice tea served was more proportion of water ice tea flavour was not there at all partha served over the counter was pathetic it was having very bad quality of oil not even ghee very much upset with the food quality this time
awesome place 1 good ambiance 2 great food veg 3 chef always comes to your table to know if we are enjoying the starters and any improvement is needed or any special starter that we prefer etc my kid loves this place and we have been there multiple times and still dont get bored
and of course the best place to celebrate your special occasions beautiful place to dine with your friends and family perfect ambiance delicious food a sweet gesture of cake from the restaurant itself and song by the staff making it more special and the varieties of kulfis
good service very good receiving naturevery well satisfied with his service and the foodoutstanding service by azad hussain with good responsibility towards customers
loved the food ambience is good deserts could be somewhat better but overall i would recommend this place staff is friendly chicken is the best of all the dishes they serve
this was my first time at a barbeque nation ive heard great things about it people sounded like they serve food from heavennow let me tell you about my experience at this outlet not going to judge the other outlets the service was not good we had to call em more than thrice to get the starters served the chicken tasted stale fish and prawns were amazing though they were serving complimentary drinks i selected ice tea worst one ive ever hadthe good thing about this place their manager he knew we werent happy tried his best to make things right for us made the chef come to our table which felt good and cared fori liked the ambience of this place will definitely give another chance to this outlet
i visited this branch for independence day lunch with two of my friends as usual barbecue nation was superb at its food and service people in hyderabad prefer abs over bn but somehow i felt bn is still a better place staff members were really good and everything was so delicious we really enjoyed our time there thumbs up
its always good to visit this place we celebrate some of our most precious days good quality and service is excellent i wish you keep this quality always
service was excellent and staffs were much polite frequent visits by chef to make sure taste is acceptable was laudable but after a point it had bit vexed us ambiance was good but space was very less hence during weekends it sounds like bring in a market
food is excellentambience is very goodloved the greek festivalazad hussian gave us a very good serviceoverall experience is excellent
amazing food and ambiencestarters were simply deliciousdesserts were also really goodwould definitely recommend everyone to visit this place
unlimited bbq food with delicious dessertsambiancebarbeque nation is located near wipro lake exactly beside deli 9 bistro this outlet of barbeque nation is quite congested as it is situated at the ground floor indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 810 people per table they play silent english songs in the backgroundfoodas we have arrived before 7pm we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails they served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque as we were six members they brought 2 barbeques in the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns chicken fish mutton paneer potatoes corns we had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours after that we moved towards the soup they have only one non veg and one veg soup we requested for hot and sour soup so they prepared for us in main course they served veg as well as non veg curries chinese and biryani finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis ice creams gulab jamun pastries firni and browniesserviceservice was very quick and the staff was very good chef himself came to our table to take the feedback
the service is too good if you are not satisfied with any food item basudev will recook as per your wish and serves it again the service is just excellent compared to other outlets
food was tasty staffs were very friendly although the options in main course as well as for starters was a bit less and service was relatively slow when compared to other barbeques still would recommend to visit once
visited it along with my friends for lunch todaymost of the staters were served was of same taste n less grilledfish n chicken n prawn everything tastes sameafter repetative reminder also they served the samealso there is not much varieties are available for statermain course is okdeserts are patheticthey are serving it for namesakeits a horrible experience overall
i visited today to be honest its waste of money everything that they serve tastes the same there is no variety of tastes fish and chicken almost tastes similar its like they have put the same spices on fish chicken mushroom and prawns deserts are simply the worst its like just name sake they are serving for those who want to taste something good its not recommended
i went there with my parents and it was totally worth it the service was extremely good and my parents loved every bit of itstarters and dessert always amazingmain course have a lot of varities but we always fill ourselves with starters that no place is left in stomach to try main courseoverall it has been one of my favourite place
qutub yasin it was really an awesome experience with these guys he was really friendly and we had a very good conversation him i will come back hungry for more
barbeque nation absolutly great place to dine with frinds r familybuffet was simply mouth watering foodambince superbservice great great exprince we hadwe want to visit again
went for lunch along with wife and bro for birthday lunch and lunch was perfect and had some decent items on menu gopal took good care of us i would recommend this place for great lunch
excellent service and food buffet this place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise the pocket pinch is slightly higher but its totally worth itthen best starters are cajun potato crispy corn mushrooms dahi kebabs corn tikki all the starters are lipsmacking make sure to keep room for the main coursei havent tried many options from the main course though dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choicecoming to desserts gal jamuns are literally out of the world try them with a scoop of vanilla icecream you wouldnt want to eat them anywhere else alongside pan kulfi is a must try there are a plenty of other desserts to choose fromalways up for a barbque grill
visited it along with my friend for dinner buffet last week most of the starters were served slowly even after repetitive reminding no response from the staff fish starters were not well cooked chicken starters crispy corn were goodmains and desserts were good as usual not much different from others
more expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place you will realise why its worth every penny from the starters to the main course everything was rich in flavour and taste softest mutton sheekh kebab ever i tasted here the menu didnt include mutton keema yet our waiter gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan his hospitality is worth mentioning the head chef came and took our feedback very warm ambience good people and great food dont miss this place
barbeque was good in taste quality of fish chicken mutton was perfect though main course variety was less overall i liked the place diligent service by all staffs the head chef also wanted feedback for the food which i personally like very much happy to visit another time
good food i visited 4 times and i like the food good hospitality ambiance is okdeserts was mouthwateringi will definitely visit again thanks for making my day special all the best
its a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation i should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention the main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package its a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals birthday celebrations or friends hangout
we went here from office a group of 17 members we were the first so seating was not an issue i had veg starters and it was marvellous for once the spice levels matched my lower than normal hyderabad spice margins the paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire the corn fried were very good food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup desserts we very good on the whole a satisfying experience
always good for non veg starters are too good than veg still overall its good always biryani will be same kasmiri flavoured hope next time i may get new flavoured biryani rest all staff and service were good
barbeques are one of my favorites barbeque nation is a perfect blend of good food and ambience always been best at servicing would be better if they try something new for birthday wishes
quick review points slippery floor be careful when you good with high heels or children perhaps they dont have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place bathrooms meant for rotten rats dirty washroom and tiny doors hefties and jumbo sizes you cant get in service ohhh they cant handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up for sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter but service time and order time is pathetic advance bookings they dont understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in pan kulfi it should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color pathetic and not worth giving tough time to your taste buds
food is good the service from the staff is excellent worth every rupee reasonable price when compared to other barbeque service from the staff is excellent
serving is nice food is good starters are good enough to get a 3 star main course is excellent when compared to absolute barbecues but star of the show is malai kulfiabsolute showstopper of the buffet
barbeques are famous for their huge spread in the starters range so was this place have almost visited most of the barbeques in the city similar menu and nothing outstanding in this restaurant taste was averagestaff were very polite and the service was good loved the pan kulfi
good place for birthdays and similar events wide variety of food items available had visited the place during some fest wherein i found lots of varieties
visited this place on our marriage anniversary food was excellent especially the starters liked the mutton sheek kebab more meat was tender and tasty bbq prawns were good as well veggies will love crispy corn here can improve on the desserts varietyservice was excellent right from the valet guy to the manager every one were courteousazad who served food for us was very assistive and always checked if we needed anything chef was kind enough to ask us about the food and cooked chicken specially for us which was terrific all seemed perfect for a perfect day
one of the best place ive ever went to buffet especially the great service provided by the agents over there it really impressed it was on my birthdae april 2 sorry for the late reviewstarting from welcome drink till the complimentary cake the food was so delicious great job
have been there for our wedding anniversary excellent service provided be staff non veg starters were too good ambiance was also good didnt feel the main course that great compared to starters didnt like chicken dum biryani enjoyed desserts a lot especially kulfithank staff for helping us and celebrating our event
you guys are really awesome what else a foodie like me can expect for lunch good food and great hospitalityi should take a minute from my routine to appreciate the service and hospitality provided by mr vibhishan and mr susheelthough you are the best the curiousness to improve by incorporating inputs feedback from customers by you are great
a place to go with friends and family hospitality is just at the next level staffs are very polite and know how to delight the customers well starters and deserts are simply awesome i dont munch much on the main course not enough space left after yummy starters i liked the way staff took my concern regarding pastry where i felt contained an egg i am vegetarian they not only ensured me that the said pastry is egg less but also offered me special chocolate chips icecream you guys are just too good in the hospitality will love keep coming back there
numerous options grilled chicken and prawn all the kulfis in different flavors are tasty pineapple jalebi was very different but okz in tastea perfect place to satisfy ur hunger with great food ambiance and servicegreat staff the service is very good you can ask them to serve the starters according to ur taste requirement spicy or mild please do the advance booking as it have rush on all the days
i have visited barbeque nation multiple times and it has been beyond my expectations every time i love the items which they keep on their grills especially the nonvegetarian ones in the nonveg ones i most like their prawns and the fish i had forgot to mention the service and the ambience the service is good and even the ambience is great in of the grill i like the crispy corn and the and some aloo thing they serve it is always awesome as we went there on jewel of the sea festival i had got crab curry with no flesh in it and we had butter naan and tandoori roti crab curry was not so great but nice the butter naan was great and even the tandoori roti was nice we even went for curd rice and dal makhni both of them were nice my overall experience with barbeque nation was awesome
